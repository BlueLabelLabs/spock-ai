The  Cage Unaired  pilot ,,1,Check the circuit.
The  Cage Unaired  pilot ,,1,"It can't be the screen then. Definitely something out there,  Captain, headed this way."
The  Cage Unaired  pilot ,,1,Their call letters check with a survey expedition. SS Columbia.  It disappeared in that region approximately eighteen years ago.
The  Cage Unaired  pilot ,,1,"Records show the Talos group has never been explored. Solar  system similar to Earth, eleven planets. Number four seems to be Class  M, oxygen atmosphere."
The  Cage Unaired  pilot ,,1,"We aren't going to go, to be certain?"
The  Cage Unaired  pilot ,,1,"Preliminary lab survey ready, sir."
The  Cage Unaired  pilot ,,1,"Yes, sir."
The  Cage Unaired  pilot ,,1,Spock here.
The  Cage Unaired  pilot ,,1,"There is no survivors' encampment, Number One. This is all some  sort of trap. We've lost the Captain. Do you read?"
The  Cage Unaired  pilot ,,1,"The inhabitants of this planet must live  deep underground, and probably manufacture food and other needs down  there. Our tests indicate the planet surface, without considerably more  vegetation or some animals, simply too barren to support life."
The  Cage Unaired  pilot ,,1,Exactly. An illusion placed in our minds by this planet's  inhabitants.
The  Cage Unaired  pilot ,,1,"They may simply be studying the Captain, to find out how Earth  people are put together. Or it could be something more."
The  Cage Unaired  pilot ,,1,"Look. Brains three times the size of ours. If we start buzzing  about down there, we're liable to find their mental power is so great  they could reach out and swat this ship as though it were a fly."
The  Cage Unaired  pilot ,,1,We've located a magnetic field that seems to  come from their underground generator.
The  Cage Unaired  pilot ,,1,"If our measurements and readings are an illusion also, one could  find oneself materialised inside solid rock."
The  Cage Unaired  pilot ,,1,The women!
The  Cage Unaired  pilot ,,1,Address intercraft.
The  Cage Unaired  pilot ,,1,This is the acting captain speaking. We have no choice now but  to consider the safety of this vessel and the remainder of the crew.  We're leaving. All decks prepare for hyperdrive. Time warp factor.
The  Cage Unaired  pilot ,,1,Engine room!
The  Cage Unaired  pilot ,,1,Mister Spock here. Switch to rockets. We're blasting out.
The  Cage Unaired  pilot ,,1,Nothing. But for the batteries we'd lose gravitation and oxygen.
The  Cage Unaired  pilot ,,1,Could be we've waited too long. It's collecting all the  information stored in this fly. They've decided to swat us.
The  Cage Unaired  pilot ,,1,Mister Spock here.
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,"Your move, Captain."
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,I'll have you checkmated your next move.
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,"Irritating? Ah, yes. One of your Earth emotions."
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,The fact one of my ancestors married a human female
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,Not large enough even for a lifeboat.
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,"More like destroyed the ship in this case. Look at it. Burnt,  pitted."
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,He played most illogically. His next move should have been the  rook.
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,The tapes are burnt out. Trying the memory banks.
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,Getting something from the recorder now.
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,Decoding memory banks. I'll try to interpolate. The Valiant had  encountered a magnetic space storm and was being swept in this  direction.
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,"Swept past this point, about a half light year out of the  galaxy, they were thrown clear, turned, and headed back into the galaxy  here. I'm not getting it all. The tapes are pretty badly burned. Sounds  like the ship had encountered some unknown force. Now, orders, counter  orders, repeated urgent requests for information from the ship's  computer records for anything concerning ESP in human beings."
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,"Severe damage. Seven crewmen dead. No, make that six. One  crewman seemed to have recovered. That's when they became interested in  extrasensory perception. More than interested, almost frantic about it.  No, this must be garbled. I get something about destruct. I must have  read it wrong. It sounded like the captain giving an order to destroy  his own ship."
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,Force field of some kind.
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,Sensor beam on.
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,Deflectors full intensity.
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,"Deflectors say there's something there, sensors say there isn't.  Density negative. Radiation negative. Energy negative."
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,Negative!
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,"Damage control reports, all stations!"
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,"Main engines are out, sir. We're on emergency power cells.  Casualties, nine dead."
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,"I think we've found that answer, Doctor."
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,"Before the Valiant was destroyed, its captain was frantically  searching for ESP information on his crew."
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,"Are there not also those who seem to see through solid objects,  cause fires to start spontaneously?"
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,Doctor Dehner is speaking of normal ESP power.
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,"He's reading even faster now than just a few  moments ago. Is that Gary Mitchell, the one you used to know?"
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,"Our subject is not Gary Mitchell. Our concern is, rather, what  he is mutating into."
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,Have you noted evidence of unusual powers?
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,"And on my monitor screen I could see Mitchell smiling each time  it happened, as if this ship and crew were almost a toy for his  amusement."
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,"In less time than that, he will have attained powers we can't  understand and can't cope with. Soon we'll be not only useless to him,  but actually an annoyance."
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,"We'll never reach an Earth base with him aboard, Jim. You heard  the mathematics of it. In a month he'll have as much in common with us  as we'd have with a ship full of white mice."
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,Recommendation one. There's a planet a few light days away from  here. Delta Vega. It has a lithium cracking station. We may be able to  adapt some of its power packs to our engines.
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,It is the only possible way to get Mitchell off this ship.
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,Then you have one other choice. Kill Mitchell while you still  can.
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,"It is your only other choice, assuming you make it while you  still have time."
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,"The captain of the Valiant probably felt the same way, and he  waited too long to make his decision. I think we've both guessed that."
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,He's regaining consciousness.
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,"Fighting the force field drained his strength, for a while at  least. He could be handled now."
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,He tried to get through the force field again. His eyes changed  back faster. He didn't become as weak.
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,Because she feels. I don't. All I know is logic. In my opinion  we'll be lucky if we can repair this ship and get away in time.
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,If he should try to stop us
Where  No Man Has Gone Before ,"22 Sep, 1966  ",2,"I felt for him, too."
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,One degree to overlap. Stand by to  photograph. Now.
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,"Negative, Lieutenant. We are the first to reach this far."
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,"Deflectors, full intensity."
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,"Evasive maneuvers, Mister Sulu."
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,Sound alarm.
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,Countermand alarm. All engines full stop.
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,"Ahead slow. Steer a course around it, Mister Sulu."
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,"Quite unnecessary to raise your voice, Mister Bailey. All  engines stop. Sound the alert."
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,"All decks have reported green, Mister Bailey."
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,And when the Captain arrives he will expect a full report on
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,"It does sound most inconvenient, however. Have you considered  having it removed?"
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,"Reporting, sir. Sensors show it is solid,  but its composition is unknown to us."
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,"I believe it adds up to either one of two possibilities. First,  a space buoy of some kind."
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,Flypaper.
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,Negative. It would make us appear too weak.
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,Radiation from the short end of the spectrum increasing.
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,Radiation increasing.
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,Radiation nearing the tolerance level.
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,Radiation at the tolerance level.
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,"Radiation passing the tolerance level, entering lethal zone."
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,Growing. We can take only a few more seconds of this.
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,"Nothing, Captain. No contacts, no objects in  any direction."
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,"Speculate? No. Logically, we'll discover the intelligence which  sent out the cube."
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,"Probably both, and if you're asking the logical decision to make"
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,Has it occurred to you that there's a certain inefficiency in  constantly questioning me on things you've already made up your mind  about?
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,"Exceptionally strong contact. Not visual  yet. Distant spectrograph. Metallic, similar to cube. Much greater  energy reading."
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,"Tractor beam, Captain. Something's grabbed us, hard."
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,Fascinating.
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,"Reading goes off my scale, Captain. Must be a mile in diameter."
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,"Captain, we're being invaded by exceptionally strong sensor  probes everywhere. Our electrical systems, our engines."
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,"They're shutting off some of our systems, Captain. Brilliant.  Extremely sophisticated in their methods."
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,Enough to warn other Earth ships.
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,Marker on course. Heading back the way we
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,Might be interesting to see what they look like if I can locate  where that voice is coming from.
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,Switching to screen. I believe I can get something visual.
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,I was curious to see how they appeared.
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,Jim.
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,They're certainly aware by now that we're totally incapable of  it.
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,"In chess, when one is outmatched, the game is over. Checkmate."
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,"I'm s, I regret that I can find no other logical alternative."
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,"However, it was well played. I regret not having learned more  about this Balok. In some manner he was reminiscent of my father."
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,Quite the contrary. She considered herself a very fortunate  Earth woman.
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,"A very interesting game, this poker."
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,"I have visual contact, Captain."
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,About two thousand metric tons.
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,"Engine systems coming on, Captain."
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,Tractor beam again.
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,He's sneaked power down a bit.
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,"We're superheating. Intermix temperature, seven thousand four  hundred degrees. Seven five, seven six, eight thousand degrees."
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,"Two thousand degrees above maximum. Eight four, eight five,  eight six. She'll blow soon!"
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,That may not be wise. He got a signal through to the mother ship.
The  Corbomite Maneuver ,"10 Nov, 1966  ",3,"For it, Captain?"

Mudd's  Women ,"13 Oct, 1966  ",4,"Difficult to say, Captain. We're getting no registration beam  from it."
Mudd's  Women ,"13 Oct, 1966  ",4,"Sir, he's pushing his engines too hard."
Mudd's  Women ,"13 Oct, 1966  ",4,"Approaching an asteroid belt, Captain. Schiller rating three  five."
Mudd's  Women ,"13 Oct, 1966  ",4,"Sensor reading on the vessel. I make it out as a small class J  cargo ship, and his engines are super-heating."
Mudd's  Women ,"13 Oct, 1966  ",4,How many more in your crew?
Mudd's  Women ,"13 Oct, 1966  ",4,What's wrong?
Mudd's  Women ,"13 Oct, 1966  ",4,It'll take longer on battery power.
Mudd's  Women ,"13 Oct, 1966  ",4,"Curious. You're certain this was everyone aboard, Mister Walsh?  No other crewmen?"
Mudd's  Women ,"13 Oct, 1966  ",4,You can explain that to the Captain.
Mudd's  Women ,"13 Oct, 1966  ",4,Deck twelve.
Mudd's  Women ,"13 Oct, 1966  ",4,"The Commander of the transport to see you, Captain."
Mudd's  Women ,"13 Oct, 1966  ",4,"I'm well aware of that, Mister Scott."
Mudd's  Women ,"13 Oct, 1966  ",4,Better rig a by-pass circuit.
Mudd's  Women ,"13 Oct, 1966  ",4,"Needed on the bridge, Captain."
Mudd's  Women ,"13 Oct, 1966  ",4,The entire ship's power is feeding through  one lithium crystal.
Mudd's  Women ,"13 Oct, 1966  ",4,"And that crystal won't hold up, not pulling all our power  through it."
Mudd's  Women ,"13 Oct, 1966  ",4,"There's a lithium mining operation on Rigel 12. High-grade ore,  I've heard."
Mudd's  Women ,"13 Oct, 1966  ",4,Mister Farrell has the course. Less than two day's travel.
Mudd's  Women ,"13 Oct, 1966  ",4,"Rigel 12, Mister Farrell. You have the course.   Captain's log, Stardate 1329.2. On board the U.S.S.  Enterprise, a ship's hearing is being convened against the transport  vessel's captain. I'm becoming concerned about the almost-hypnotic  effect produced by the women."
Mudd's  Women ,"13 Oct, 1966  ",4,State your name for the record.
Mudd's  Women ,"13 Oct, 1966  ",4,Your correct name.
Mudd's  Women ,"13 Oct, 1966  ",4,State your correct name for the record.
Mudd's  Women ,"13 Oct, 1966  ",4,"Any past offenses, Mister Mudd?"
Mudd's  Women ,"13 Oct, 1966  ",4,"We can sustain this orbit for three days, seven hours."
Mudd's  Women ,"13 Oct, 1966  ",4,"Even burned and cracked, they're beautiful.  Destroying them was a shame."
Mudd's  Women ,"13 Oct, 1966  ",4,"Conserving batteries, sir. Half power."
Mudd's  Women ,"13 Oct, 1966  ",4,"We don't have the time to spare, Captain."
Mudd's  Women ,"13 Oct, 1966  ",4,"The storm is ionising the atmosphere, Captain. Getting difficult  to probe through it."
Mudd's  Women ,"13 Oct, 1966  ",4,"Infrared reading. Check traverse three, grid  zero four zero."
Mudd's  Women ,"13 Oct, 1966  ",4,There's a heat unit operating in there. It could be a cookstove.
Mudd's  Women ,"13 Oct, 1966  ",4,Mudd?
Mudd's  Women ,"13 Oct, 1966  ",4,I'm happy the affair is over. A most annoying emotional episode.
Mudd's  Women ,"13 Oct, 1966  ",4,"The fact that my internal arrangement differs from yours,  Doctor, pleases me no end."
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,"Is there something I can do for you, Captain?"
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,"Well, Doctor McCoy seemed to think I should check on you."
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,"Well, our good doctor said that you were acting like a wild man,  demanded brandy."
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,"Hmm. Well, in that case, if you'll excuse the intrusion Captain,  I'll get back to my work."
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,Captain.
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,Doctor McCoy reports that you demanded this brandy in Sickbay  and left with it. I found this bottle in Yeoman Rand's quarters.
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,"You can go now, Yeoman.  There's only one logical  answer. We have an impostor aboard.   Captain's Log, stardate 1672.9. On the planet's  surface, temperatures are beginning to drop, our landing party there in  growing jeopardy. Due to the malfunction of the ship's transporter, an  unexplained duplicate of myself definitely exists."
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,"About your double, Captain."
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,"We can't take a chance on killing it. We have no previous  experience, no way of knowing what would happen to you."
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,"How shall we explain it to them, Captain? The search parties are  to capture you?"
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,"The search parties, Captain."
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,"Captain, no disrespect intended, but you must surely realise you  can't announce the full truth to the crew. You're the Captain of this  ship. You haven't the right to be vulnerable in the eyes of the crew.  You can't afford the luxury of being anything less than perfect. If you  do, they lose faith, and you lose command."
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,"Understood, Captain.   Captain's Log, stardate 1673.1. Something has  happened to me. Somehow, in being duplicated, I have lost my strength  of will.  Decisions are becoming more and more difficult."
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,About the phaser weapons to be set for stunning force and  locked.
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,Thermal heaters were transported down. They duplicated. They  won't operate.
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,Spock here.
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,Acknowledged. Continue the search.
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,"Apparently, this double, however different in temperament, has  your knowledge of the ship, its crew, its devices. This being the case,  perhaps we can outguess him by determining his next move. Knowing how  the ship is laid out, where would you go to elude a mass search?"
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,"Set and locked on base cycle to stun, not to  kill. What about your phaser, Captain? Don't you think we ought to get  some help, Captain?"
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,"Captain, you ordered me to tell you."
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,"Judging from my observations, Captain, you're rapidly losing the  power of decision."
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,"Yes, always, Doctor. We have here an unusual opportunity to  appraise the human mind, or to examine, in Earth terms,  the roles of good and evil in a man. His negative side, which you call  hostility, lust, violence, and his positive side, which Earth people  express as compassion, love, tenderness."
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,"Yes, and what is it that makes one man an exceptional leader? We  see indications that it's his negative side  which makes him strong, that his evil side, if you will, properly  controlled and disciplined, is vital to his strength. Your negative  side removed from you, the power of command begins to elude you."
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,"If your power of command continues to weaken, you'll soon be  unable to function as Captain. You must be prepared for that."
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,"If I seem insensitive to what you're going through, Captain,  understand it's the way I am."
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,"This is Spock, Mister Sulu. You'll have to  hold on a little longer. There's no other way. Survival procedures,  Mister Sulu."
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,"We've attached some bypass and leader circuits to compensate for  the difference. Tied directly into the impulse engines, there shouldn't  be more than a five point variation in the velocity balance. I suggest  we send the animal through.  Captain."
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,It's painless and quick. The animal will be unconscious for only  a few minutes.
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,Energise. Reverse.
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,The shock of putting him back together seems to have been too  much for him.
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,"For once, I agree with you."
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,"No autopsy is necessary to know that the animal was terrified,  confused. It was split into two halves and suddenly thrust back  together again. Thus shock induced by blind terror."
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,It couldn't understand. You can. You have your intelligence  controlling your fear.
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,"Aren't you forgetting something, Captain?"
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,Your men on the planet surface. How much time do they have left?
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,"Being split in two halves is no theory with me, Doctor. I have a  human half, you see, as well as an alien half, submerged, constantly at  war with each other. Personal experience, Doctor. I survive it because  my intelligence wins over both, makes them live together. Your  intelligence would enable you to survive as well."
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,"Are you relinquishing your command, Captain?"
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,"Captain, I thought the plan   OTHER"
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,We'll let the captain handle this.   OTHER
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,"You'll have to hold on to him, Captain."
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,Captain?
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,"Understood, Captain."
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,Ready.
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,"Right away, Captain."
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,"All sections report ready, sir."
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,"Shall I pass that on to the crew, sir?"
The  Enemy WIthin ,"6 Oct, 1966 ",5,"The, er, impostor had some interesting qualities, wouldn't you  say, Yeoman?"
The  Man Trap ,"8 Sep, 1966 ",6,"Miss Uhura, your last sub-space log contained an error in the  frequencies column."
The  Man Trap ,"8 Sep, 1966 ",6,Cry?
The  Man Trap ,"8 Sep, 1966 ",6,"Well, since it is illogical for a communications officer to  resent the word frequency, I have no answer."
The  Man Trap ,"8 Sep, 1966 ",6,"Vulcan has no moon, Miss Uhura."
The  Man Trap ,"8 Sep, 1966 ",6,Bridge acknowledging.
The  Man Trap ,"8 Sep, 1966 ",6,Explain.
The  Man Trap ,"8 Sep, 1966 ",6,"Lieutenant, my demonstration of concern will not change what  happened. The transporter room is very well-manned and they will call  if they need my assistance."
The  Man Trap ,"8 Sep, 1966 ",6,No mistake in our record tapes. Borgia plant. Its sole deadly  property is alkaloid poison.
The  Man Trap ,"8 Sep, 1966 ",6,"Check out perfectly. They arrived here nearly five years ago.  Visited by various vessels, made fairly heavy shipments out, of  artefacts and reports. However, there has been a marked drop in  shipments during the last year."
The  Man Trap ,"8 Sep, 1966 ",6,Fascinating.
The  Man Trap ,"8 Sep, 1966 ",6,Sodium chloride. Not a trace of it.
The  Man Trap ,"8 Sep, 1966 ",6,He would die almost instantly.
The  Man Trap ,"8 Sep, 1966 ",6,"Something odd, Captain. You said two people."
The  Man Trap ,"8 Sep, 1966 ",6,"We get a reading on only one person, probably Crater. He's  circling as if searching for something."
The  Man Trap ,"8 Sep, 1966 ",6,"Yes, sir."
The  Man Trap ,"8 Sep, 1966 ",6,"The simple fact is unless there's something seriously wrong with  the ship's equipment, there's only one person within a one hundred mile  circle."
The  Man Trap ,"8 Sep, 1966 ",6,"Spock cutting in, Captain. Something here, through the arches to  your left."
The  Man Trap ,"8 Sep, 1966 ",6,Green.
The  Man Trap ,"8 Sep, 1966 ",6,Or something did.
The  Man Trap ,"8 Sep, 1966 ",6,Crater knows the creature. If we could take him alive.
The  Man Trap ,"8 Sep, 1966 ",6,"Obviously, taking him alive is going to be difficult."
The  Man Trap ,"8 Sep, 1966 ",6,Why risk your life for his?
The  Man Trap ,"8 Sep, 1966 ",6,Acknowledged. Crater!
The  Man Trap ,"8 Sep, 1966 ",6,The Earth buffalo. What about it?
The  Man Trap ,"8 Sep, 1966 ",6,And now they're gone. Is that what you mean?
The  Man Trap ,"8 Sep, 1966 ",6,Always in the past tense.
The  Man Trap ,"8 Sep, 1966 ",6,"Supplies of salt have been set out as bait at all decks and  engineering levels, Captain. However, no one or nothing has approached  them as yet."
The  Man Trap ,"8 Sep, 1966 ",6,"Your attitude is laudable, Doctor, but your reasoning is  reckless."
The  Man Trap ,"8 Sep, 1966 ",6,"A very interesting hypothesis, Doctor. Briefing room."
The  Man Trap ,"8 Sep, 1966 ",6,"Recommend we use truth serum, Captain."
The  Man Trap ,"8 Sep, 1966 ",6,"I'll accompany you, Doctor."
The  Man Trap ,"8 Sep, 1966 ",6,It wasn't McCoy. It was the creature. It hit me.  Crater grabbed my phaser. I wondered about McCoy. Doubt had crossed my  mind.
The  Man Trap ,"8 Sep, 1966 ",6,"Fortunately, my ancestors spawned in another ocean than yours  did. My blood cells are quite different."
The  Man Trap ,"8 Sep, 1966 ",6,"It's killing the Captain. Shoot it, Doctor, quickly!"
The  Man Trap ,"8 Sep, 1966 ",6,"This is not Nancy.  If she were Nancy,  could she take this?"
The  Man Trap ,"8 Sep, 1966 ",6,"Is that Nancy, Doctor?"
The  Man Trap ,"8 Sep, 1966 ",6,"Something wrong, Captain?"
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,Check out the life-support systems.
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,Someone strangled this woman.  TORMOLEN The other four are back there.
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,Dead?
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,Engineer at his post?  TORMOLEN He's frozen there like he didn't care.
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,The rest?
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"Be certain we expose ourselves to nothing. Spock here. Do you  read, Enterprise?"
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,All station personnel are dead.
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"Unknown, Captain. It's like nothing we've dealt with before.   Captain's Log: Stardate 1704.2. The science party  we were to have picked up has been found dead. Life support systems had  been turned off. Station personnel, frozen to death. Conditions highly  unusual. Meanwhile, we remain in orbit to complete our mission, close  scientific measurement of the break-up of this planet."
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"You received my signal, Mister Scott."
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"The readings are perfectly normal for me, Doctor, thank you, and  as for my anatomy being different from yours, I am delighted. Captain."
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"I wish I could say, Captain. The circumstances were quite  bizarre, however our record tapes may show us something."
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"Next tape, please."
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,Thank you.
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,He'd used the computer room as if it were an amusement gallery.
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"It could be some form of space madness we've never heard of, but  it would have to be caused by something. Our spectro-readings showed no  contamination, no unusual elements present."
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,Instruments register only those things they're designed to  register. Space still contains infinite unknowns.
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"We will need top efficiency, Captain. It'll be a tricky orbit.  When the planet begins to go, there may be drastic changes in gravity,  mass, magnetic field."
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,It's beginning. Unusually rapid shifts.
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"All scanning stations manned, all recorders functioning, Captain."
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"Obviously, this planet is condensing more rapidly than expected.  A valuable study. We may be seeing Earth's distant future. Before its  sun went dark, this planet was remarkably similar to yours."
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"Psychiatric file, personality quotients."
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"It's doubtful he meant to. He was confused, self-tortured."
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,His capacity for self-doubt has always been rather high. What  puzzles me is what brought it to the surface with so much force.
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"Planet breakup is imminent, Captain. Shrinking in size at an  increasing rate. As the planet continues to shrink in size, its surface  moves away from us."
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,Exactly. We must be prepared to respond instantly to any sudden  change.
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,Rate of compaction seems constant.
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,Acknowledged.
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,Why isn't Mister Sulu at this station?
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"Take over here, Rand."
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,You haven't answered my question. Where is Mister Sulu?
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"You're relieved, Mister Riley. Lieutenant Uhura, take over this  station."
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"Report to Sickbay, Mister Riley."
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,Security. Mister Riley is headed for Sickbay. See to it he  arrives. Captain Kirk to the Bridge.
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"Lieutenant Brent, relieve Miss Uhura."
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"Nonviolent at this stage. Slightly disoriented. Riley seemed  rather pleased with himself, as if he were"
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,Precisely.
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"Fascinating. A pattern is developing. First, Tormolen. Hidden  personality traits being forced to the surface. Then Riley, who fancies  himself a descendant of  Irish kings, and now Sulu, who is at heart a swashbuckler out of your  18th century."
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,Gravity pull increasing. We've shifted to two percent and should  stabilise our position.
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"Engine room, we need power!"
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,Take D'Artagnon here to Sickbay.
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"Captain. At our present rate of descent, we have less than  twenty minutes before we enter planet atmosphere."
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"Status reports, all sections."
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,Go to Alert Baker two. Seal off main sections.
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"We're going to seal off, Captain, if we can minimise the spread  of whatever this is."
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"No way, Captain. He controls the main power panels. He can  override any channel from down there. Seventeen minutes left, sir."
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"Sixteen minutes left, Captain. We've  stabilised, but still spiraling down."
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"Crewman, report to the lab!"
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,What's going on?
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"Crewman, stand aside."
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,Message from the captain.
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,We have fourteen minutes left.
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"At the rate you're proceeding, calculations show that you'll  take a minute and a half more than we have left. You can't afford a  safety factor."
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,Nurse? Where is Doctor McCoy?
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"Lab. Lab, respond please. Spock here. Lab!"
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"What is it, Nurse?"
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"Nurse, you should"
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,I'm in control of my emotions.
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,I'm sorry.
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,I am sorry.
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,Christine.
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"I'm in control of my  emotions. Control of my emotions. I am an officer. An officer. My duty.  My duty is, is. My duty is to, to. Too late. I'm sorry. To. Two, four,  six. Six. Six times six."
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,My mother. I could never tell her I loved her.
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"An Earth woman, living on a planet where love, emotion, is bad  taste."
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"I respected my father, our customs. I was ashamed of my Earth  blood.  Jim, when I feel friendship for you, I'm  ashamed."
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"t's never been done! Understand, Jim. I've spent a whole  lifetime learning to hide my feelings."
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,It's never been done.
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,Jim.
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"Jim, there is an intermix formula."
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,It's never been tested. It's a theoretical relationship between  time and antimatter.
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,Stand by to intermix. I'll call the formulae in from the Bridge.
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,Fuel temperature.
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,Raise antimatter eight and forty degrees.
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"We haven't the time. We'll have to risk it. Bridge, we're ready."
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"Are you all right, Jim?"
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"Obviously, we were successful. The engines imploded."
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,Engine power went off the scale as well. We're now travelling  faster than is possible for normal space.
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"We're back to normal time, Captain."
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"Yes, sir."
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"We've regressed in time seventy one hours. It is now three days  ago, Captain. We have three days to live over again."
The  Naked Time ,"29 Sep, 1966 ",7,"This does open some intriguing prospects, Captain. Since the  formula worked, we can go back in time, to any planet, any era."
Charlie  X ,"15 Sep, 1966 ",8,"That is a very intriguing question. Scanners show no  disturbances in this quadrant, Captain."
Charlie  X ,"15 Sep, 1966 ",8,"Doctor, didn't the boy make any reference at all to Thasians?"
Charlie  X ,"15 Sep, 1966 ",8,Charlie's very existence proves in fact there must be some  intelligent form of life on Thasus. He could not possibly have survived  alone. The ship's food concentrates would have been exhausted in a year  or so.
Charlie  X ,"15 Sep, 1966 ",8,Probes of Thasus indicate very little edible plant life.
Charlie  X ,"15 Sep, 1966 ",8,"Affirmative, Captain."
Charlie  X ,"15 Sep, 1966 ",8,"Picking up some debris on our scanners, Captain."
Charlie  X ,"15 Sep, 1966 ",8,The debris is what's left of the Antares.
Charlie  X ,"15 Sep, 1966 ",8,"Your mind is not on the game, Captain. Check. The Antares?"
Charlie  X ,"15 Sep, 1966 ",8,My own concern is more immediate. The boy.
Charlie  X ,"15 Sep, 1966 ",8,He seemed to know what happened to the Antares before we did.
Charlie  X ,"15 Sep, 1966 ",8,"And again, check."
Charlie  X ,"15 Sep, 1966 ",8,"Your illogical approach to chess does have its advantages on  occasion, Captain."
Charlie  X ,"15 Sep, 1966 ",8,"As you wish. At any rate, the game is yours."
Charlie  X ,"15 Sep, 1966 ",8,"The principles of three-dimensional chess are basically  mathematic, Charlie. You put the white here and the black on the  secondary level."
Charlie  X ,"15 Sep, 1966 ",8,"Very well.  That was a mistake, Charlie."
Charlie  X ,"15 Sep, 1966 ",8,Checkmate.
Charlie  X ,"15 Sep, 1966 ",8,If you'll excuse me.
Charlie  X ,"15 Sep, 1966 ",8,"Thasians have been referred to in our  records as having the power to transmute objects or render substances  invisible.  It has generally been regarded as legend, but Charlie does seems to  possess this same power."
Charlie  X ,"15 Sep, 1966 ",8,Agreed.
Charlie  X ,"15 Sep, 1966 ",8,"The probability is he's responsible for the destruction of the  Antares, which would indicate a total disregard for human life."
Charlie  X ,"15 Sep, 1966 ",8,"And with a weapon in him which could destroy you or anyone,  anywhere on this ship."
Charlie  X ,"15 Sep, 1966 ",8,Agreed. The struggle must remain between you and him. Should any  of us interfere
Charlie  X ,"15 Sep, 1966 ",8,We're in the hands of an adolescent.
Charlie  X ,"15 Sep, 1966 ",8,"Yes, sir. There's a Tyger, tyger, burning bright in the forest  of the night."
Charlie  X ,"15 Sep, 1966 ",8,"I'm trying to Saturn rings around my head, down a road that's  Martian red."
Charlie  X ,"15 Sep, 1966 ",8,"Once upon a midnight dreary while I pondered, weak and weary."
Charlie  X ,"15 Sep, 1966 ",8,"Jim, he'll soon reach a point where he won't back down."
Charlie  X ,"15 Sep, 1966 ",8,My legs. They're broken.
Charlie  X ,"15 Sep, 1966 ",8,I'll activate the force field myself. You  can return to your section.
Charlie  X ,"15 Sep, 1966 ",8,Out of the question.
Charlie  X ,"15 Sep, 1966 ",8,Not so far as we know.
Charlie  X ,"15 Sep, 1966 ",8,"Captain, the navigation console is clear now. The ship is  answering the helm."
Charlie  X ,"15 Sep, 1966 ",8,"Sensors show there something's there, Captain. Deflectors  indicate no solid substance."
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,"Verified, Captain."
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,"Referring to the map on your screens, you will note beyond the  moving position of our vessel, a line of Earth outpost stations.  Constructed on asteroids, they monitor the Neutral Zone established by  treaty after the Earth-Romulan conflict a century ago."
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,"Which allowed no quarter, no captives. Nor  was there even ship-to-ship visual communication. Therefore, no human,  Romulan, or ally has ever seen the other. Earth believes the Romulans  to be warlike, cruel, treacherous, and only the Romulans know what they  think of Earth. The treaty, set by sub-space radio, established this  Neutral Zone, entry into which by either side, would constitute an act  of war. The treaty has been unbroken since that time. Captain."
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,"Outpost two coming into sensor range, Captain."
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,"Sweeping the area of Outpost two. Sensor reading indefinite.  Double-checking Outpost three. I read dust and debris. Both Earth  outposts gone,  and the asteroids they were constructed on, pulverised."
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,"And showing on my sensors, Captain. At least it's still there."
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,"Outpost four disintegrated, Captain."
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,Disappeared. Interesting how they became visible for just a  moment.
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,I have a blip on the motion sensor. Could be the  intruder.
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,"Invisibility is theoretically possible, Captain, with selective  bending of light. But the power cost is enormous.   They may have solved that problem."
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,Blip has changed its heading. And in a very leisurely manoeuvre.  They may not be aware of us.
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,"His heading is now one eleven mark fourteen. The exact heading a  Romulan would take, Jim, for the Neutral Zone and home."
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,"I have a fix on it, Captain. I believe I can lock on it, get a  picture of their Bridge."
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,Very well.
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,"Steady on one eleven mark fourteen. Back on their original  course, Captain, toward the Neutral Zone."
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,From the outpost's protective shield. Cast  rodinium. This is the hardest substance known to our science.
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,Lab theorises an enveloping energy plasma forcing an implosion.
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,"Obviously, their weaponry is superior to ours, and they have a  practical invisibility screen."
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,"Or on what this vessel fails to do, Doctor."
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,I agree. Attack.
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,"Yes, indeed we do, Mister Stiles. And if Romulans are an  offshoot of my Vulcan blood, and I think this likely, then attack  becomes even more imperative."
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,"It is for them, Doctor. Vulcan, like Earth, had its aggressive  colonising period. Savage, even by Earth standards. And if Romulans  retain this martial philosophy, then weakness is something we dare not  show."
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,Do you want a galactic war on your conscience?
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,"A comet, magnitude seven, dead ahead, and the intruder changing  course toward it."
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,"Quite ordinary. An ionised mass, a trail of frozen vapour  particles."
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,It leaves a visible trail.
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,Intruder now bearing directly for comet's tail.
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,"He's maintaining that bearing, Captain."
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,"We're losing sensor contact, Captain."
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,"It'll take time to correct, sir."
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,"Impossible, Captain."
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,"Phasers operational, Captain. Intruder bearing one eleven mark  fourteen."
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,"He may think we're destroyed, Captain."
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,Intruder holding steady. Course one eleven mark fourteen.
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,"They did, Doctor."
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,"We're still on our side, Captain."
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,Motion sensor signal stopped.
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,"Vessel wreckage. Metal moulds, conduit, plastoform and a body,  Captain. However."
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,"Insufficient mass, sir."
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,"Simple debris. Not a vessel, a trick."
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,"Nothing, sir. No motion out there at all. We've lost them,  Captain.  Captain's log, Stardate 1709.6. We are at the  Neutral Zone. Have lost contact with the intruder. No reaction on our  motion sensors  but believe the Romulan vessel to be somewhere close by. With all  engines and systems shut down, the Enterprise is also playing the  silent waiting game in hope of regaining contact."
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,"Captain, I must make further repairs on the transfer coil. It's  giving out again."
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,Debris on our scanners.
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,"Same type as before, sir, except, one metal-cased object!"
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,"Nuclear device of some kind, sir. Our phasers detonated it less  than one hundred metres away."
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,Mainly overloads and circuit burnouts.
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,"We have engine power now, Captain, if you'd like to move off and  make repairs."
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,"Damage reports, Mister Stiles?"
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,Will you require assistance here?
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,"Yes, very well, thank you, Captain."
Balance  of Terror ,"15 Dec, 1966 ",9,I saved a trained navigator so he could return to duty. I am  capable of no other feelings in such matters.
What  Are Little Girls Made Of? ,"20 Oct, 1966 ",10,"Ship's record banks show little we don't already know about this  planet, Captain.  Gravity is one point one of Earth, atmosphere within safety limits."
What  Are Little Girls Made Of? ,"20 Oct, 1966 ",10,"It may have been inhabited once, but the sun in this system has  been fading steadily for a half million years. Now, Doctor Korby, often  called the Pasteur of archaeological medicine. His translation of  medical records from the Orion ruins revolutionised our immunisation  techniques."

What  Are Little Girls Made Of? ,"20 Oct, 1966 ",10,Captain!
What  Are Little Girls Made Of? ,"20 Oct, 1966 ",10,"Captain, We finished ahead of schedule."
What  Are Little Girls Made Of? ,"20 Oct, 1966 ",10,You're going back down with the command pack?
What  Are Little Girls Made Of? ,"20 Oct, 1966 ",10,"Yes. very well, Captain."
What  Are Little Girls Made Of? ,"20 Oct, 1966 ",10,"No problems here, sir."
What  Are Little Girls Made Of? ,"20 Oct, 1966 ",10,"Security, Spock here. Status of your landing party?"
What  Are Little Girls Made Of? ,"20 Oct, 1966 ",10,Have them meet me in the transporter room after the Captain has  beamed down.
What  Are Little Girls Made Of? ,"20 Oct, 1966 ",10,"Captain, are you all right? Nurse? Where's Doctor Korby?"
What  Are Little Girls Made Of? ,"20 Oct, 1966 ",10,"Frankly, I was rather dismayed by your use of the term  half-breed, Captain. You must admit it is an unsophisticated  expression."
Dagger  Of The Mind ,"3 Nov, 1966 ",11,"I have them, Captain. Closing off deck fourteen, search in  progress."
Dagger  Of The Mind ,"3 Nov, 1966 ",11,"Negative in the deck area, Captain. He may have gotten out.  Expanding search to adjoining sections."
Dagger  Of The Mind ,"3 Nov, 1966 ",11,"Interesting. Your Earth people glorify organised violence for  forty centuries, but you imprison those who employ it privately."
Dagger  Of The Mind ,"3 Nov, 1966 ",11,"We disposed of emotion, Doctor. Where there is no emotion there  is no motive for violence."
Dagger  Of The Mind ,"3 Nov, 1966 ",11,"Fifty seven minutes, thirty seconds, Captain."
Dagger  Of The Mind ,"3 Nov, 1966 ",11,An identification tape from our ship's library on Doctor Simon  Van Gelder.
Dagger  Of The Mind ,"3 Nov, 1966 ",11,"Doctor Van Gelder, Captain. No mistake. There's a full ID tape  on him."
Dagger  Of The Mind ,"3 Nov, 1966 ",11,Assigned there six months ago as Doctor Adams' associate.
Dagger  Of The Mind ,"3 Nov, 1966 ",11,"Gentlemen, I suggest you ask Doctor Adams if he wants Van Gelder  returned."
Dagger  Of The Mind ,"3 Nov, 1966 ",11,"I believe we should, Jim."
Dagger  Of The Mind ,"3 Nov, 1966 ",11,"Problem, Captain?"
Dagger  Of The Mind ,"3 Nov, 1966 ",11,"Neural neutraliser. Can you explain that, Doctor Van Gelder?"
Dagger  Of The Mind ,"3 Nov, 1966 ",11,This room. What happens there?
Dagger  Of The Mind ,"3 Nov, 1966 ",11,"Can you give us your present location,  Captain?"
Dagger  Of The Mind ,"3 Nov, 1966 ",11,Then you're with Doctor Adams now.
Dagger  Of The Mind ,"3 Nov, 1966 ",11,"Captain, Van Gelder has made reference to a particular treatment  room. The term was neural neutraliser."
Dagger  Of The Mind ,"3 Nov, 1966 ",11,"Van Gelder is extremely agitated, Captain,  and warns that you are in danger."
Dagger  Of The Mind ,"3 Nov, 1966 ",11,"When do you plan to beam back up, Captain?"
Dagger  Of The Mind ,"3 Nov, 1966 ",11,And you will continue to check in every four hours?
Dagger  Of The Mind ,"3 Nov, 1966 ",11,Destroy how? What?
Dagger  Of The Mind ,"3 Nov, 1966 ",11,"I've never used it on a human, Doctor."
Dagger  Of The Mind ,"3 Nov, 1966 ",11,"It's a hidden, personal thing to the Vulcan people, part of our  private lives."
Dagger  Of The Mind ,"3 Nov, 1966 ",11,"It could be dangerous. Do you understand? It requires I make  pressure changes in your nerves, your blood vessels."
Dagger  Of The Mind ,"3 Nov, 1966 ",11,"This will not affect you, Doctor McCoy, only the person I touch.  It is not hypnosis."
Dagger  Of The Mind ,"3 Nov, 1966 ",11,You begin to feel a strange euphoria. Your body floats.

Dagger  Of The Mind ,"3 Nov, 1966 ",11,"Acknowledged, Captain. Warp factor one."
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,"Not a vessel, a ground source. The third planet in this solar  system, according to my instruments."
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,"Measuring the planet now, Captain. It's spheroid-shaped,  circumference twenty four thousand eight hundred seventy four miles.  Mass six times ten to the twenty first power tons. Mean density five  point five one seven. Atmosphere oxygen, nitrogen."
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,"Affirmative, Captain."
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,"More the, er, mid-1900s I would say, Captain, approximately  1960."
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,Readings indicate that natural deterioration has been taking  place on this planet for at least several centuries.
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,"Not conclusive, Yeoman. The evidence would suggest that the  distress signal is automated."
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,"Definitely humanoid, in spite of the distortion."
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,About three hundred years.
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,"Right, Captain."
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,Guards! Cover me.
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,"Children, Captain. Lots of them. We couldn't  begin to get close to them. They just seemed to scurry away, like  animals. Only children."
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,"Being a red-blooded human obviously has its disadvantages. Now  there you have a museum piece, Doctor.  Lens  type, manually operated, light-activated."
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,"Progress report, genetics section, Life Prolongation Project."
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,"This was three hundred years ago, Captain."
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,But children become adults.
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,"Doctor, there are certain glandular changes which take place  upon entering puberty, are there not?"
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,"Is it not possible that these children here, as they enter  puberty, contract the disease?"
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,"It's illogical. It does not follow. All the adults on this  planet died three hundred years ago, but there are children in the  streets."
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,"There may be other emotions at work in this case, Captain."
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,She's becoming a woman.
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,Spock here.
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,"Acknowledged, Lieutenant. I have their calculations now."
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,"According to their life prolongation plan, what they thought  they were accomplishing, a person would age only one month for every  one hundred years of real time."
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,"Exactly, Yeoman. Evidently through some miscalculation, this  virus annihilated the entire adult population in a very short period,  leaving only the children."
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,Could very well be immensely old.
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,"Difficult, if we can't even get a glimpse of them."
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,"Impossible. They know the area too well, like mice."
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,"Is at least three hundred years older than you are, Yeoman.  Think about it."
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,Acknowledged.
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,"This fellow made these notes in the last weeks after the  disaster began. I disregard these last entries. He said himself he was  too sick, too far gone to be sure he wasn't already mad, and I agree,  but based on the entries he made before that, I know how much time we  have. The ship's computers will verify my figures."
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,Our guess was correct. They contract the disease as they enter  puberty and their metabolism changes. The notes would indicate it  doesn't become acute for a month or so. I estimate she has perhaps five  or six weeks left.
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,"The older the victim, the more rapid the progress of the  disease."
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,"I am a carrier. Whatever happens, I can't go back to the ship,  and I do want to go back to the ship, Captain."
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,I presume my calculations are correct.
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,Spock here.
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,"Verified, Captain. We have seven days.   Captain's Log, supplement. This is the second day  of the seven left to us. We've found nothing. Enterprise is standing by  with labs and computers ready to assist us."
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,"Unfortunately, they weren't successful. We've seen the results."
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,"No, nothing."
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,"Communicators, Captain, they're gone."
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,"The nitrogen cycle, it has to be."
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,That is a very good question.
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,"That's not all, Captain. We've got to find those communicators."
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,"We've got to have those communicators, Jim."
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,"Without them, it could be a beaker full of death."
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,We must. The vaccine could be fatal.
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,Bickering is pointless. I'll check on the Captain's progress.
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,Not yet.
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,He injected himself with the vaccine. He was unconscious when I  found him.
Miri ,"Oct 27, 1966 ",12,The blemishes are fading. They're fading. Who will understand  the medical mind?

The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,"A good empirical research scientist. Steady, reputable,  occasionally brilliant."
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,"I have no information on that, Captain. We are ready to leave  orbit."
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,"Ready to resume course, Captain."
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,What kind? Personnel? Cargo?
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,How did you know this lady was coming  aboard?
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,"May I inquire as to our course, Captain?"
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,Benecia Colony is eight light years off our course.
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,"We'll arrive stardate 2825.3, Captain, approximately fifteen  hundred Benecia time."
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,Captain.
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,"He came up from engineering, Captain."
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,Any explanation? He's a fine young officer. He's bound to  consider this transfer a disciplinary action.
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,"Spare me your philosophical metaphors, Doctor. The Captain is  acting strangely. I'm asking if you've noticed."
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,My father's race was spared the dubious benefits of alcohol.
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,It occurred. I dismissed it.
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,Did you know that he suddenly transferred Lieutenant Riley to  engineering?
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,"No, thank you."
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,"Full personal dossiers on the following names. Doctor Thomas  Leighton, Anton Karidian, Lieutenant Kevin Riley, and Captain James T.  Kirk."
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,"Correlate. Check their past histories. Report any item, any past  episode or experience they all have in common."
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,"I will continue, Doctor. According to our library banks, it  started on the Earth colony of Tarsus Four, when the food supply was  attacked by an exotic fungus and largely destroyed. There were over  eight thousand colonists and virtually no food. And that was when  Governor Kodos seized full power and declared emergency martial law."
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,"You may not have heard it all. Kodos began to separate the  colonists. Some would live, be rationed whatever food was left. The  remainder would be immediately put to death. Apparently he had his own  theories of eugenics."
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,"Perhaps not. But he was certainly among the most ruthless, to  decide arbitrarily who would survive and who would not, using his own  personal standards, and then to implement his decision without mercy.  Children watching their parents die. Whole families destroyed. Over  four thousand people. They died quickly, without pain, but they died.  Relief arrived, but too late to prevent the executions. And Kodos?  There never was a positive identification of his body."
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,His history begins almost to the day where Kodos disappeared.
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,"He'd better. There were nine eye witnesses who survived the  massacre, who'd actually seen Kodos with their own eyes. Jim Kirk was  one of them.  With the exception of Riley and Captain Kirk, every other eye witness  is dead. And my library computer shows that wherever they were, on  Earth, on a colony, or aboard ship, the Karidian Company of Players was  somewhere near when they died."
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,You've got to pull him through.
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,"If he dies, the only one who'll be able to identify Kodos is the  Captain. And he'll be the next target.  Captain's log, stardate 2819.1. Ship's officer  Riley's condition worsening. Doctor McCoy making lab analysis to  determine cause and antidote. Entire crew deeply concerned."
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,Someone tried to poison him.
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,I don't believe that and neither do you. I want the Captain to  see that report.
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,Now.
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,"Can we predict the same for you, Captain?"
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,Lieutenant Riley was a witness. So were you.
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,Someone tried to kill him.
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,"You should be told the difference between empiricism and  stubbornness, Doctor. I checked with the library computer, just as you  did. I got the same information."
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,Is my personal business when it might interfere with the smooth  operation of this ship.
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,It could happen.
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,"Even in this corner of the galaxy, Captain, two plus two equals  four. Almost certainly an attempt will be made to kill you. Why do you  invite death?"
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,He is.
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,"Logic, Captain. Doctor Leighton was murdered while the Karidian  Company was on Planet Q. Now an attempt has been made against Riley  while the company is on board the Enterprise."
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,Shh. Listen. Do you hear it? That low hum.
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,On overload.
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,You can't stay.
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,Evacuate this section. Seal it off. Clear  section C4 and C5.
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,"I believe we have a match, Captain."
The  Conscience of the King   ,"8 Dec, 1966 ",13,"Ready to leave Benecia orbit, Captain."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,Power up. All instruments activated. All readings normal. All  go.
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,Position?
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Make up your mind please, Mister Latimer."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Considerably, Mister Boma."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Stop forward momentum, Mister Latimer."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Galileo to Enterprise. Galileo to Enterprise. Come in, please."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Galileo to Enterprise. Galileo to Enterprise. We are out of  control, being pulled directly into the heart of Murasaki three one  two. Being hit by violent radiation on outer hull. Course three point  two five"
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"I'd say your evaluation is reasonable, Mister Boma."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Picturesque descriptions will not mend broken circuits, Mister  Scott. I think you'll find your work is cut out for you. Galileo to  Enterprise. Galileo to Enterprise. Come in, please."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"I expect nothing, Mister Scott. It is merely logical to try all  the alternatives. Doctor McCoy, a reading on the atmosphere, please."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Just the facts, Doctor."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Thank you for your opinion. It will be duly noted. You're  recording this, Yeoman?"
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Mister Scott, if you'll make a survey of the damage, please."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Gentlemen, I think we should move outside, make room for Mister  Scott to do his work. Mister Latimer, Mister Gaetano, you'll arm  yourselves and scout out the area, keeping in visual contact with the  ship."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Under present conditions, extremely poor."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"If the ionisation effect is as widespread as I believe it is,  Doctor, they'll be searching for us without instrumentation, by visual  contact only. On those terms, this is a very large planet."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Not as long as we're grounded. We may be here for a very long  time, Doctor."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"My big chance? For what, Doctor?"
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"I am a logical man, Doctor."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Perhaps, Doctor, but I know of no better way to begin. I realise  command does have its fascinations, even under circumstances such as  these. But I neither enjoy the idea of command, nor am I frightened of  it. It simply exists. And I will do whatever logically needs to be  done.  Excuse me."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,In what way?
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,The weight of three grown men.
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Doctor McCoy, with very few exceptions we use virtually every  piece of equipment aboard this craft in attaining orbit. There's very  little excess weight, except among the passengers."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Unless the situation changes radically, yes."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"As commanding officer, the choice will be mine."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"A very quaint idea, Mister Boma, but I do believe I'm better  qualified to make the selection than any random drawing of lots."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"My choice will be a logical one, arrived at through logical  means."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"But attaining a desired goal always is, Doctor. Now gentlemen, I  suggest we move outside to make a further examination of the hull in  the event we've overlooked any minor damage."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Come on, Boma."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,What was it?
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,Nothing there.
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,I don't doubt your word.
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,Folsom Point.
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"There's a remarkable resemblance to the Folsom Point discovered  in 1925, old world calendar, New Mexico, North America. A bit more  crude about the shaft, I believe. Not very efficient."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Am I in error, Mister Boma?"
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Then what, Mister Boma?"
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"My concern for the dead will not bring him back to life, Mister  Boma."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Bringing him back to the ship should not interfere with our  repair efforts. If you need assistance, I"
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,Perhaps if you were to channel the second  auxiliary tank through the primary intake valve.
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Excellent, Doctor."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,Which would still leave us at least one hundred and fifty pounds  overweight.
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"It is more rational to sacrifice one life than six, Doctor."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,You might be wise to start.
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,For what?
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Mister Boma, we're working against time."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Doctor, perhaps you know the correct words for such an occasion."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"My place is here. If you please, Doctor."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"By dealing with first things first, I hope to increase our  chances of staying alive. Well, Mister Scott."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,What happened?
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"That would seem to solve the problem of who to leave behind.  Consider the alternatives, Mister Scott."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Mister Scott, there are always alternatives."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,Wood rubbing on some kind of leather.
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,Not a tribal culture. Their artefacts are too primitive. More  likely a loose association of some sort.
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"How, Mister Boma?"
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,I'm frequently appalled by the low regard you Earthmen have for  life.
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,Mister Boma?
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,Doctor McCoy?
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"It does, indeed. It seems logical to me, also. But to take life  indiscriminately,"
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"I am not interested in the opinion of the majority, Mister  Gaetano. Components must be weighed. Our danger to ourselves as well as  our duties to other life forms, friendly or not. There's a third  course."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,I think not. Doctor McCoy.
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,You and Yeoman Mears return to the ship. Assist Mister Scott in  any way possible. We'll be back shortly.
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Gentlemen, you'll follow my orders to the letter, firing only  when so instructed, and at my designated targets."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"We'll fire to frighten, Mister Gaetano, not to kill."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"I am in command, Mister Gaetano. The orders and the  responsibility will be mine. Follow me."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"I hear them. They're directly ahead of us. Several, I believe.  Direct your phasers to two o'clock and to ten o'clock."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Yes, I know. But fortunately, I'm giving the orders. Take aim  please, and fire when I give a signal."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,Fire.  Cease fire.   They should think twice before bothering us again.
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"It was not necessary. Fear will do for us what needs to be done.  Mister Boma, you will return with me to the Galileo. Mister Gaetano,  you remain on guard here. Keep in contact with the ship."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Yes, we found them. They won't bother us again."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Go, Mister Scott."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"That's all very well, but we don't have a substitute supply."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,They would also seem to be our only hope.
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Yeoman, your phaser."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"They won't attack for at least several hours. By then, with  luck, we'll be gone."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"We don't have to maintain it very long, Mister Scott. In less  than twenty four hours, the Enterprise will be forced to abandon its  search in order to make a rendezvous. If we can't maintain orbit after  that time, it won't make any difference. If we burn up in a decaying  orbit or die here on the planet's surface, we shall surely die. Doctor,  your phaser. Go to work, Mister Scott."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Take this back to Mister Scott for conversion, please Doctor."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,And give this to Mister Scott in  the event I don't return.
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"I have a certain scientific curiosity about what's become of  Mister Gaetano. Return to the ship, please."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,Most illogical reaction. We demonstrated our superior weapons.  They should have fled.
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,Of course.
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Doctor, I am not responsible for their unpredictability."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"They're studying us, for the moment."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"My opinion, Mister Boma."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,Seal the windows!
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Mister Boma, your tone is increasingly hostile."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,Curious. Most illogical.
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Strange. Step by step, I have made the correct and logical  decisions. And yet two men have died."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"I do seem to have miscalculated regarding them, and inculcated  resentment on your parts. The sum of the parts cannot be greater than  the whole.   MCCOY A little less analysis and more action. That's what we need,  Mister Spock."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"How much longer, Mister Scott?"
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Mister Scott, how much power do we have left  in the ship's batteries?"
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,Will they electrify the exterior of this ship?
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Get to the centre of the ship. Don't touch the plates. Be sure  you're insulated. Stand by. Are you ready, Scott?"
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,All right. Go.  Again! Again!
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,I believe we've used enough. Mister Scott. I suggest you  continue draining the phasers.
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,For the moment.
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"The moment they discover they're not seriously hurt, they'll be  back. Meanwhile, please check the aft compartment. See if there's  anything you can unload to lighten the ship."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,It will of course have to be left behind.
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,I wouldn't recommend it. The creatures won't be far away.
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,It would expose members of this crew to unnecessary peril.
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Gentlemen. All right, Mister Boma, you'll have your burial,  provided the creatures will permit it."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,How about weight?
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,And how long can we hold it?
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,To land here again? Not a very attractive possibility.
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Doctor McCoy. Mister Boma. When can we lift off, Scott?"
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Gentlemen, The ship will lift off in exactly ten minutes. You  have that long to bury Mister Gaetano. Now, it appears to be clear  outside, at least for the moment. I'll assist you. Hurry."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,Get into the ship! Immediate lift off!
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,No! Go back! Lift off! Go back! No!
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"All right, All right! Go! Go! Go! Go!"
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Go, Scott!"
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,I told you to lift off!
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Get us off, Scott!"
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Quite right, Mister Scott. There's somebody holding us down. All  systems are go, but we're not moving."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,Our boosters.
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,Would you rather stay here?
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"May I remind you we have yet to achieve orbit, nor can we  maintain it long. An hour from now we may be right back where we  started from."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Gentlemen, by coming after me, you may well have destroyed what  slim chance you had for survival. The logical thing for you to have  done was to have left me behind."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"That is a most illogical attitude. Orbit in one minute, Mister  Scott. Fuel status?"
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,It is the usual end of a decaying orbit.
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Infinitely preferable to the kind of death we'd be granted on  the planet's surface, I should think."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,Did l? I may have been mistaken.
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,The Enterprise is surely on course for Makus Three by now. I for  one do not believe in angels.
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,Yes. My first command.
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Galileo to Enterprise. Galileo to Enterprise, come in, please.  Galileo to Enterprise. Come in, please."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Perhaps, Mister Boma."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,No one out there to see it.
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,Totally illogical. There was no chance.
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,Captain.
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Quite correct, Captain."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Quite simply, Captain. I examined the problem from all angles,  and it was plainly hopeless. Logic informed me that under the  circumstances, the only possible action would have to be one of  desperation. Logical decision, logically arrived at."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Well, I wouldn't put it in exactly those terms, Captain, but  those are essentially the facts."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"No, sir."
The  Galileo Seven ,"5 Jan, 1967  ",14,"Yes, sir."

Court  Martial ,"2 Feb, 1967  ",15,Affirmative.
Court  Martial ,"2 Feb, 1967  ",15,Negative.
Court  Martial ,"2 Feb, 1967  ",15,Affirmative.
Court  Martial ,"2 Feb, 1967  ",15,"But the computer is inaccurate, never the less."
Court  Martial ,"2 Feb, 1967  ",15,It reports that the jettison button was pressed before the Red  Alert.
Court  Martial ,"2 Feb, 1967  ",15,And that is impossible.
Court  Martial ,"2 Feb, 1967  ",15,"No, I was occupied. The ship was already on Yellow Alert."
Court  Martial ,"2 Feb, 1967  ",15,I do not dispute it. I merely state that it is wrong.
Court  Martial ,"2 Feb, 1967  ",15,I know the Captain. He is in
Court  Martial ,"2 Feb, 1967  ",15,"Lieutenant, I am half Vulcanian. Vulcanians do not speculate. I  speak from pure logic. If I let go of a hammer on a planet that has a  positive gravity, I need not see it fall to know that it has in fact  fallen."
Court  Martial ,"2 Feb, 1967  ",15,"Gentlemen, human beings have characteristics just as inanimate  objects do. It is impossible for Captain Kirk to act out of panic or  malice. It is not his nature."
Court  Martial ,"2 Feb, 1967  ",15,Yes. In my opinion.
Court  Martial ,"2 Feb, 1967  ",15,"Mister Finney is top of duty roster, Captain."
Court  Martial ,"2 Feb, 1967  ",15,"Attention, Commander Finney, report to pod for reading on ion  plates."
Court  Martial ,"2 Feb, 1967  ",15,"Officer posted, Captain."

Court  Martial ,"2 Feb, 1967  ",15,Chess.
Court  Martial ,"2 Feb, 1967  ",15,Explain.
Court  Martial ,"2 Feb, 1967  ",15,That is true.
Court  Martial ,"2 Feb, 1967  ",15,"Why, thank you, Doctor. I've just won my fourth game."
Court  Martial ,"2 Feb, 1967  ",15,Observe for yourself. Rook to king's pawn four.
Court  Martial ,"2 Feb, 1967  ",15,"Now, this is the computer's move. And now mine.  Checkmate. Mechanically, the computer's flawless. Therefore,  logically, its report of the captain's guilt is infallible. I could not  accept that, however."
Court  Martial ,"2 Feb, 1967  ",15,Exactly. I programmed it myself for chess some months ago. The  best I should have been able to attain was a draw.
Court  Martial ,"2 Feb, 1967  ",15,"Transporter room, stand by. We're beaming down."
Court  Martial ,"2 Feb, 1967  ",15,Five in all.
Court  Martial ,"2 Feb, 1967  ",15,Affirmative.
Court  Martial ,"2 Feb, 1967  ",15,"I personally programmed the computer for chess months ago. I  gave the machine an understanding of the game equal to my own. The  computer cannot make an error and assuming that I do not either, the  best that could normally be hoped for would be stalemate after  stalemate, and yet I beat the machine five times. Someone, either  accidentally or deliberately, adjusted the programming and therefore  the memory banks of that computer."
Court  Martial ,"2 Feb, 1967  ",15,Affirmative.
Court  Martial ,"2 Feb, 1967  ",15,"The Captain, myself, and the records officer."
Court  Martial ,"2 Feb, 1967  ",15,"Affirmative. Until he was lost, our records officer was  Lieutenant Commander Finney."

"The  Menagerie, part 1 ","17 Nov, 1966  ",16,"Sir, I must point out that there are three officers of command  rank available. Yourself, Commodore Mendez, and Captain Christopher  Pike."
"The  Menagerie, part 1 ","17 Nov, 1966  ",16,I believe you'll find he's still on the active duty list.

"The  Menagerie, part 1 ","17 Nov, 1966  ",16,"I cannot tell you at this time, sir."

"The  Menagerie, part 1 ","17 Nov, 1966  ",16,"As I stated, gentlemen, this was thirteen years ago. We were on  routine patrol when the ship's sensors detected something ahead. At  first we were not certain what it was."

Shore  Leave ,"29 Dec, 1966 ",17,"They should be sending up a report momentarily, Captain.  Something wrong?"
Shore  Leave ,"29 Dec, 1966 ",17,"Doctor McCoy is correct, Captain. After what this ship has been  through in the last three months, there is not a crewman aboard who is  not in need of rest. Myself excepted, of course."
Shore  Leave ,"29 Dec, 1966 ",17,"Not necessary in my case, Captain. On my planet, to rest is to  rest, to cease using energy. To me, it is quite illogical to run up and  down on green grass using energy instead of saving it."
Shore  Leave ,"29 Dec, 1966 ",17,"Very well, Captain. Something I did come to discuss."
Shore  Leave ,"29 Dec, 1966 ",17,"I picked this up from Doctor McCoy's log. We have a crewmember  aboard who's showing signs of stress and fatigue. Reaction time down  nine to twelve percent, associational reading norm minus three."
Shore  Leave ,"29 Dec, 1966 ",17,"He's becoming irritable and quarrelsome, yet he refuses to take  rest and rehabilitation. Now, He has that right, but we've found"
Shore  Leave ,"29 Dec, 1966 ",17,"James Kirk. Enjoy yourself, Captain. It's an interesting planet.  You'll find it quite pleasant. Very much like your Earth."
Shore  Leave ,"29 Dec, 1966 ",17,"I'm getting strange readings from the planet  surface, Captain. Some sort of power field down there."
Shore  Leave ,"29 Dec, 1966 ",17,Could be coming from beneath the planet's  surface. Patterns indicate some sort of industrial activity.
Shore  Leave ,"29 Dec, 1966 ",17,Any chance these could be hallucinations?
Shore  Leave ,"29 Dec, 1966 ",17,That sounds like a painful reality.
Shore  Leave ,"29 Dec, 1966 ",17,Your signal is very weak. Can you turn up  your gain?
Shore  Leave ,"29 Dec, 1966 ",17,"Captain, shall I beam down an armed party?"
Shore  Leave ,"29 Dec, 1966 ",17,"Necessary, Captain. Unable to contact you by communicator, and  the transporter is useless to us now. As I told you before, there's an  unusual power field down here. It's soaking up all the energy at the  source. I calculated the rate of its growth, and reasoned that I just  might be able to transport one more person."
Shore  Leave ,"29 Dec, 1966 ",17,"This is not human skin tissue, Captain. It more closely  resembles the cellular casting we use for wound repairs. Much finer, of  course."
Shore  Leave ,"29 Dec, 1966 ",17,"This is definitely a mechanical contrivance. It has the same  basic cell structure as the plants here, even the trees, the grass."
Shore  Leave ,"29 Dec, 1966 ",17,"I'm saying that these are all multicellular castings. The  plants, the animals, the people. They're all being manufactured."
Shore  Leave ,"29 Dec, 1966 ",17,All we know for certain is that they act exactly like the real  thing. Just as pleasant or just as deadly.
Shore  Leave ,"29 Dec, 1966 ",17,"At this point, Captain, my analysis may not sound very  scientific."
Shore  Leave ,"29 Dec, 1966 ",17,"There is one slight possibility, very slim, but nevertheless.  Captain, what were your thoughts just before you encountered the people  you described?"
Shore  Leave ,"29 Dec, 1966 ",17,"Captain, wait."
Shore  Leave ,"29 Dec, 1966 ",17,"Did you enjoy it, Captain?"
Shore  Leave ,"29 Dec, 1966 ",17,Which supports a theory I've been formulating.
Shore  Leave ,"29 Dec, 1966 ",17,"Yes. Somehow our thoughts are read, these things are quickly  manufactured and provided for us."
Shore  Leave ,"29 Dec, 1966 ",17,Yes. We must all control our thoughts.
Shore  Leave ,"29 Dec, 1966 ",17,"The force field we encountered is obviously underground,  manufacturing these things. Passages lead to the surface. Just for  example, when Rodriguez thought of a tiger"
Shore  Leave ,"29 Dec, 1966 ",17,Captain.
Shore  Leave ,"29 Dec, 1966 ",17,The term is amusement park.
Shore  Leave ,"29 Dec, 1966 ",17,An old Earth name for a place where people could go to see and  do all sorts of fascinating things.
Shore  Leave ,"29 Dec, 1966 ",17,I tend to agree.
Shore  Leave ,"29 Dec, 1966 ",17,"Captain, I'll go back aboard  ship and take over. With all due respect to the young lady, I've  already had as much shore leave as I care for."
Shore  Leave ,"29 Dec, 1966 ",17,"Did you enjoy your rest, gentlemen?"
Shore  Leave ,"29 Dec, 1966 ",17,Most illogical.

The  Squire of Gothos ,"12 Jan, 1967  ",18,"I'll entertain any theories, Mister DeSalle. Any at all."
The  Squire of Gothos ,"12 Jan, 1967  ",18,"You're quite correct, Doctor. Prepare transporter room."
The  Squire of Gothos ,"12 Jan, 1967  ",18,"No, Mister Scott. Neither you nor I can be spared here. Mister  DeSalle, equip the landing party with full communications, armament,  and life-support gear. Mister Jaeger, your geophysical knowledge may be  crucial down there. Doctor McCoy will accompany. If those peculiar  signals are coming from Captain Kirk or Lieutenant Sulu, their  rationality is in question. Dismissed."
The  Squire of Gothos ,"12 Jan, 1967  ",18,"Very good. Transmit coordinates to Mister Scott. Once on the  planet's surface, you'll establish contact with us immediately. Use the  laser beacon if necessary. Ready, Scott?"
The  Squire of Gothos ,"12 Jan, 1967  ",18,Activate.
The  Squire of Gothos ,"12 Jan, 1967  ",18,"I don't, Mister Scott. It simply exists. Artificial perhaps, or  a freak of nature. The fact remains that life can exist in that area."
The  Squire of Gothos ,"12 Jan, 1967  ",18,Apply a fine tuning on our sensors. Locate any life forms in  that stable area.
The  Squire of Gothos ,"12 Jan, 1967  ",18,"Affirmative. But if the Captain is down there and alive, that's  where he'll have to be. We'll attempt to transport up any living beings  our sensors detect."
The  Squire of Gothos ,"12 Jan, 1967  ",18,"Or stand by and do nothing, Mister Scott.       And this, of course, is an array of your battle flags and pennants  dating back to the Crusades, to Hannibal's invaders, the Grecian war  galleys, and the hordes of Persia. Can't you imagine it, Captain? The  thousands of men marching off to their deaths, singing beneath these  banners. Doesn't it make your blood run swiftly?"
The  Squire of Gothos ,"12 Jan, 1967  ",18,"They didn't, Captain. Not clearly. We merely beamed up all life  forms in a given area."

The  Squire of Gothos ,"12 Jan, 1967  ",18,Affirmative.
The  Squire of Gothos ,"12 Jan, 1967  ",18,I object to you. I object to intellect without discipline. I  object to power without constructive purpose.
The  Squire of Gothos ,"12 Jan, 1967  ",18,"It may be unappetizing, Doctor, but it is very logical."
The  Squire of Gothos ,"12 Jan, 1967  ",18,"Fascinating is a word I use for the unexpected. In this case, I  should think interesting would suffice."
The  Squire of Gothos ,"12 Jan, 1967  ",18,"That his food has no taste, his wine no flavour? No. It simply  means that Trelane knows all of the Earth forms, but none of the  substance."
The  Squire of Gothos ,"12 Jan, 1967  ",18,Evidently.

The  Squire of Gothos ,"12 Jan, 1967  ",18,The mirror.
The  Squire of Gothos ,"12 Jan, 1967  ",18,You noted yourself he never gets very far from it. I suppose it  could be vanity.
The  Squire of Gothos ,"12 Jan, 1967  ",18,"A machine with the ability to turn energy into matter guided by  thought waves. It would have a very complex memory bank, and would be  extremely sophisticated."
The  Squire of Gothos ,"12 Jan, 1967  ",18,I think not. A device capable of keeping out this planet's  natural atmosphere would be immense.
The  Squire of Gothos ,"12 Jan, 1967  ",18,"Free, Captain?"

The  Squire of Gothos ,"12 Jan, 1967  ",18,I hardly find that fitting.

Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,"Locked on to the enemy, Captain. They're moving toward the high  ground.  They've locked on to my tricorder."
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,Very ingenious. They fed back my own impulses and built up an  overload.
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,Any word from the Enterprise?
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,Very clever. As to the reason?
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,"You allude to invasion, Captain, yet positive proof"
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,"Not necessarily, sir. Several possible explanations"
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,"Very well, then. If that's the case, you must make certain that  the alien vessel never reaches its home base."
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,"Virtually nothing, Captain. No records of any explorations.  There are rumours of certain strange signals on subspace channels.  However, none has ever been recorded."
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,"Nothing specific, Captain. Unscientific rumours only. More like  space legends."
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,"A sustained warp seven speed will be dangerous, Captain."
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,"You mean to destroy the alien ship, Captain?"
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,I thought perhaps the hot pursuit alone might be sufficient.  Destruction might be unnecessary.
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,"The destruction of the alien vessel will not help that colony,  Jim."
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,I merely suggested that a regard for sentient life
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,"Very clear, Captain."
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,It would appear someone is curious about us.
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,"Computer lock ready, Captain. All systems standing by."
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,"Same as the alien, Captain."
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,"All systems report normal, Captain. No ascertainable damage."
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,"We're being held in place, Captain, apparently from that solar  system."
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,We are being held.
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,"No, sir. An unidentifiable power."
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,Have you tried overload?
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,How about bypassing the transformer banks? Feed the impulse  engines directly.
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,"Lieutenant Uhura, have sensors learned anything about the nature  of the force which holds us here?"
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,No indication of its composition? Gravimetric? Magnetic?  Electronic?
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,"Leave channel one open, Lieutenant, just in  case."
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,"I'm going to wait, Doctor. There's little else I can do."
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,"If I could help him, I would. I cannot."
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,"He's out there, Doctor. Out there somewhere in a thousand cubic  parsecs of space, and there's absolutely nothing we can do to help him."
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,"This is the U.S.S. Enterprise calling the  Metrons. Our channels are open. Come in, please. We urgently desire a  conference. Please answer."
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,"But it has happened, Doctor."
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,"Yes, indeed, Doctor, if only there were. Notice the substance  encrusting that rock. Yes. Unless I'm mistaken, it's potassium nitrate."
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,"Perhaps nothing, Doctor.  Perhaps everything."
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,"It may well be possible, Doctor. We know very little about that  section of the galaxy."
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,Perhaps. That is something best decided by diplomats.
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,Yes.
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,"Fascinating. Good. Good.  He knows, Doctor. He has reasoned it out."
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,Yes. Yes.
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,"An invention, Doctor. First potassium nitrate, and now if he can  find some sulphur and a charcoal deposit or ordinary coal."
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,"Diamonds. The hardest known substance. Impelled by sufficient  force, they would make formidable projectiles."
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,"Recall your basic chemistry, Doctor. Gunpowder."
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,Coal.
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,"If he has the time, Doctor. If he has the time."
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,"After you touched off your primitive cannon, Captain, we lost  the picture the Metron was sending us."
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,Most of it. I would be interested in knowing what finally  happened.
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,I've frequently had my doubts.
Arena ,"19 Jan, 1967  ",19,"A thousand years, Captain?  Well, that gives us a little time."
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,"Very typical, Captain. Iron-silicon base, oxygen-hydrogen  atmosphere, largely arid, no discernible life. No surprises."
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,Captain.
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,"Incredible, Captain."
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,"What my instruments read is totally unbelievable, Captain.  Twice, for a split second each time, everything within range of our  instruments seemed on the verge of winking out."
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,"I have given you the facts, Captain. The entire magnetic field  in this solar system simply blinked. The planet below, the mass of  which we're measuring, attained zero gravity."
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,Is non-existence.
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,"Captain, scanners now report a life object on the planet surface  below."
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,"Inexplicable, Captain. This reading began at approximately the  moment that the pulsation phenomenon began to subside."
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,"A living being. Body temperature 98.5 Fahrenheit. Mass,  electrical impulses, movement. It is apparently human, Captain."
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,Almost to the second.
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,None.
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,Possible. Very possible.
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,"Negative, Captain. Scanners indicate situation normal."
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,"Nothing. Illogical. An effect of such proportions, unexplainable  by any established physical laws that I'm aware of. I have been able to  ascertain one fact. Though the effect, whatever it was, was  unquestioningly widespread, it was strongest here on the planet beneath  us."
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,"Third, a closer examination of the planet's surface would be in  order. My job, sir?"
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,"Negative, Captain. Anything from our guest?"
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,"Lieutenant Uhura communicated that information. I ordered  re-confirmation on our sensors. They indicate no living creature on  this planet. I suggest, Captain, that you've been lied to."
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,"I fail to comprehend your indignation, sir. I've simply made the  logical deduction that you are a liar."
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,"I'm trying, Captain."
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,"Captain, readings of the effect indicate it centred here on this  planet, almost on this very spot."
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,"Negative, Captain. I can no more explain the occurrence of the  second phenomenon than I can the first."
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,"That a single creature, a humanoid could be responsible for an  effect of such magnitude?"
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,Indeed.
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,Affirmative.
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,"Captain, I only know for certain that the occurrence of the  phenomenon coincides exactly with the moments that Lazarus has his  alleged confrontations."
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,"Main screen on, Lieutenant."
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,"Source of radiation, Captain."
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,Because it is not there.
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,"What I mean, Captain, is that according to our usual scanning  procedures, there is nothing there that could be causing that effect."
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,"Affirmative. I confess I am somewhat at a loss for words. It may  be described, though loosely and inaccurately, as a rip in our  universe."
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,"A kind of physical warp, Captain, in which none of our  established physical laws apply with any regularity. However, with the  dilithium crystals, I was able to localise it."
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,You refer to the humanoid?
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,Why does he need the crystals? For what reason?
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,Unable to locate the source of radiation.
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,"It has simply disappeared, Captain."
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,"True, Captain, but more significant to me is the fact that our  ship's instruments are specifically designed to locate and identify any  object in our universe, be it energy or matter."
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,Correct. Which would seem to be impossible.
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,Perfect working condition.
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,"Nor in our universe, Captain. It came from outside."
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,"The possible existence of a parallel universe has been  scientifically conceded, Captain."
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,Unquestionably a warp. A distortion of physical laws on an  immense scale.
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,Indeed. I point out that a hole in the universe or in a simple  container can either allow the contents to escape
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,There has been no evidence of a large-scale invasion.
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,"Difficult, Captain. One moment, paranoid, the next, calm, mild,  rational. Almost as if he were two men."
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,Through which these two beings are somehow enabled to pass.
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,"The cut on his forehead. First he has it, then it's gone, then  he has it again."
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,"Quite right. Unquestionably, there are two of him."
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,"Jim, madness has no purpose or reason, but it may have a goal.  He must be stopped, held. Destroyed if necessary."
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,"Two parallel universes project this. One positive, the other  negative. Or, more specifically, one matter, the other antimatter."
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,"Precisely. Under certain conditions, when two identical  particles of matter and antimatter meet"
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,"Annihilation, Jim. Total, complete, absolute annihilation."
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,Lazarus. A trick to get the crystals.
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,Spock to Bridge.
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,Lazarus.
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,Take these crystals to the Enterprise.
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,What of Lazarus?
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,"There is, of course, no escape for them, sir."
The  Alternative Factor ,"30 Mar, 1967   ",20,"Captain, the universe is safe."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"Except for secondary systems, everything is out, sir. We're on  impulse power only."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"If Mister Scott is still with us, auxiliaries should be on  momentarily.  Are you all right,  Lieutenant?"
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,Mister Scott is still with us.
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,Captain? Casualty reports indicate only minor injuries.  Engineering reports warp engines  non-operational. Mister Scott overrode the automatic helm setting and  is holding us in orbit on impulse power.
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"Earth, Captain. We were on a general course in this direction  when we were pulled in by the star. Apparently the breakaway threw us  on in the same direction."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"We are too low in the atmosphere to retain this orbit, Captain.  Engineering reports we have sufficient impulse power to achieve escape  velocity."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"Apparently, Captain, so are we."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"Whiplash propelled us into a time warp, Captain. Backward. Exact  chronometer readings in a few moments."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,Verified. Scanners report some type of craft approaching from  below us. Under cloud cover and closing.
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"Positive identification, Captain. Aircraft is an interceptor,  equipped with missiles, possibly armed with nuclear warheads. If he  hits us with one, he might damage us severely, perhaps beyond our  capacity to repair under current circumstances."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"Captain, this type of aircraft might be too fragile to take our  tractor beam."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"Aircraft is breaking up, Captain."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,Neither have I.
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,Captain.
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"We've achieved a stable orbit out of Earth's atmosphere. Our  deflectors are operative, enough to prevent our being picked up again  as a UFO. And Mister Scott wishes to speak to you about the engines."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,Captain Christopher.
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"We cannot return him to Earth, Captain. He already knows too  much about us and is learning more. I do not specifically refer to  Captain Christopher, but suppose an unscrupulous man were to gain  certain knowledge of man's future?  Such a man could manipulate key industries, stocks, and even nations.  and in so doing, change what must be. And if it is changed, Captain,  you and I and all that we know might not even exist."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"Yes, sir.  {Captain's quarters]"
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"I have investigated it, Captain. To correct the fault will  require an overhaul of the entire computer system and a minimum of  three weeks at a  Starbase."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,It also has an unfortunate tendency to giggle.
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"We put in at Cygnet Fourteen for general repair and maintenance.  Cygnet Fourteen is a planet dominated by women. They seemed to feel the  ship's computer system lacked a personality. They gave it one. Female,  of course."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,I have run a computer check on all historical tapes. They show  no record of any relevant contribution by John Christopher.
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"Crude methods, but effective."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,I made an error in my computations.
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,I find that we must return Captain Christopher to Earth after  all.
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"Poor choice of words on my part. I neglected, in my initial  run-through, to correlate the possible contributions by offspring. I  find, after running a crosscheck on that factor, that your son Colonel  Shaun Geoffrey Christopher headed, or will head, the first successful  Earth-Saturn probe, which is a rather significant"
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"The doctor is correct. Unless we return Captain Christopher to  Earth, There will be no Colonel Shaun Geoffrey Christopher to go to  Saturn."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"Acknowledging that we must return Captain  Christopher, there are several problems, prime of which is the  explanation of his return.  We tracked his plane wreckage down after our tractor beam crushed it.  It crashed in an open section of southern Nebraska."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,And Captain Christopher himself complicated the matter.
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"Captain, our tractor beam caught and crushed an Air Force plane.  It'll be impossible to explain this as anything other than a genuine  UFO. Possibly alien, definitely destructive."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"A theory. A reverse application of what happened to us.  Logically, it could work. Also, logically, there are a hundred  variables, any one of which could put us in a worse position than we're  in now."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,Not at all. You'll simply be one of the thousands who thought he  saw a UFO.
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"Fifteen minutes, twenty eight seconds."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"It is a fact, Doctor, that prowling by stealth is more  time-consuming than a direct approach. In our case"
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,I am.
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"You may be correct, Doctor. Open communicator channel."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,Beam up immediately.
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"We'll know in a moment, Doctor."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"Spock here. Are you all right, Captain?"
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"I don't believe there'll be trouble in that respect, Captain."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,Our guest seems quite satisfied to remain where he is.
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"Your decision to beam up was quite correct,  Mister Sulu."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,Spock here.
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"Do so now, engineer. We'll need all power to test our theory."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,Poor photography.
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"I am aware of that, Doctor. This is the first officer. Captain  Christopher to the briefing room."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"Quite logical, Captain. Can you give us the co-ordinates to beam  down a landing party near those interrogation rooms?"
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"I can't do that, Captain."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"Mister Sulu, you and Captain Christopher will beam down with me.  The captain will provide the co-ordinates for the transporter chief."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"One for you, one for me. Set them on heavy stun force."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"In fact, I do. But only to a certain point."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,Energise.
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"Don't you find that painful, Captain?"
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,He knew the exact beam down co-ordinates for this section of the  base. It was necessary to bring him along.
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,I suspected he might not wish to return with us.
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"Mister Scott and I both agree that the only  possible solution is the slingshot effect, like the one that put us  here. My computations indicate that if we fly toward the sun, seek out  its magnetic attraction, then pull away at full power, the whiplash  will propel us into another time warp."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"Logically, as we move faster and faster toward the sun, we'll  begin to move backward in time. We'll actually go back beyond  yesterday,  beyond the point when we first appeared in the sky. Then, breaking free  will shoot us forward in time, and we'll transport you back before any  of this happened."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"Since we've passed Mercury, the sun's pull on us has increased  greatly. From here, we'll move even faster. And Captain, notice the  chronometers. They've started backward. Minute by minute, the speed of  time passage will now increase."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"Approaching breakaway point. On the countdown. Ten, nine, eight,  seven, six, five, four, three, two, one."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,We've broken free and heading back.
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"Chronometers moving forward again, Captain."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,Computed.
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"Twenty minutes, sir. It'll be close."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"Ten minutes. Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two,  one."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"Approaching second beaming, Captain."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,Now.
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"Approaching our century, Captain. Braking should begin now."
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,Fifty years to go.
Tomorrow  is Yesterday ,"26 Jan, 1967  ",21,"Forty, thirty."
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,Odd. The expression on that man's face. The mindlessness. Vacant  contentment.
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,Evidently they're not prepared to deal with out right  disobedience. How did you know?
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,Your analysis seems logical.
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,"Fascinating. This is merely a hollow tube, Captain. No  mechanism."
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,"Totally illogical. Yesterday, without apparent cause or reason,  they wrought total havoc. Yet today, now"
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,"Telepathy, Captain."
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,Amazing in this culture.
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,It took a very advanced technology to construct a device like  this. Inconsistent with this environment
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,"Strong power generations, Captain. Near here, but radiating in  all directions."
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,An underground? How are you organised?
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,Powerful enough to destroy a starship? Affirmative.
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,Captain.
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,"Sensor beams, very strong. We're being probed. In this  direction."

The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,"Too strong, Captain. Can't be blocked."
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,"Projection, Captain. Unreal."

The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,Where's Doctor McCoy?
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,I should say they've been here and been removed.
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,Evidently a maximum security establishment. Are you armed?
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,The natural result of being subjected to a hypersonic.
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,"Sound waves. Stronger, they might have killed us. As it was,  they merely rendered us unconscious."
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,"We shouldn't depend on that happening again, Captain. In a  society as well organised as this one seems to be, I cannot conceive of  such an oversight going uncorrected. Interesting, however. Their  reaction to your defiance was remarkably similar to the reaction of a  computer when fed insufficient or contradictory data."
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,"Quite human, Captain. It's simply that all the facts are not yet  in. There are gaps."
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,Like Sulu.
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,"You've been corrected, Captain. You'd better go."
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,"Doctor McCoy, what will happen to him?"
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,Impossible. He's under extremely powerful control.
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,"Little else we can do, unless you can think of a way to get  through that door."
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,"And apparently commanding powers far beyond our comprehension.  Not simple, not ridiculous. Very, very dangerous."

The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,Captain.
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,Quite all right. Be careful of Doctor McCoy.
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,"I am formulating a theory, Captain."
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,Not here. The doctor.
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,"This is a soulless society, Captain. It has no spirit, no spark.  All is indeed peace and  tranquillity. The peace of the factory, the tranquillity of the  machine. All parts working in unison."
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,"Until new orders are received. The question is, who gives those  orders?"
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,"There is no Landru, Captain, not in the human sense."
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,Sir?
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,"Captain, our Prime Directive of non-interference."
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,Captain.
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,Spock to Enterprise. status report.
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,"Report, Scott."
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,Captain.
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,"Useless, Captain. A projection."
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,"A machine. This whole society is a machine's concept of  perfection. Peace, harmony."
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,"The good of the Body, Captain. That's the key."
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,"Are you aiding the body, or are you destroying it?"
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,"Not necessary, Captain. They have no guidance. Possibly for the  first time in their lives."
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,Then the body dies. Creativity is necessary for the health of  the Body.
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,"What's left of him, after he built and programmed this machine  six thousand years ago."
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,Marvellous.
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,"The late Landru, Captain. A marvellous feat of engineering. A  computer capable of directing the lives of millions of human beings."
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,"Predictably metaphysical. I prefer the concrete, the graspable,  the provable."
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,"That is very kind of you, Captain."
The  Return of The Archons ,"9 Feb, 1967  ",22,How often mankind has wished for a world as peaceful and secure  as the one Landru provided.
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,"In view of code seven-ten, Captain, may I suggest"
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,"We know very little about them. Their  civilisation is advanced. They've had space flight for several  centuries, but they've never ventured beyond their own solar system.  When first contacted more than fifty years ago, Eminiar Seven was at  war with its nearest neighbour."
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,The Earth expedition making the report failed to return from its  mission. The USS Valiant. Listed as missing in space.
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,"Transporter room standing by, Captain."
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,We've selected a site which from the traffic seems to be near an  official establishment.
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,"No hostility directed toward us. No apparent notice taken of us  at all, which seems strange. They did scan us when we assumed orbit.  Obviously, they know we're here."
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,"Screens down, but all defensive details on general alert status,  Captain."
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,"Sir, we have completely scanned your planet. We find it highly  advanced, prosperous in a material sense, comfortable for your people,  and peaceful in the extreme. Yet you say you are at war. There is no  evidence of this."
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,With whom are you at war?
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,Strange.
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,Are these attacks frequent?
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,"None, Captain. Yeoman Tamula."
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,Tricorder readings. Radiation. Disturbances of any kind.
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,"Computers, Captain. They fight their war with computers.  Totally."
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,Then the attack by Vendikar was theoretical.
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,There is a certain scientific logic about it.
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,I do not approve. I understand.
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,"Limited telepathic abilities are inherent in Vulcanians,  Captain. It may work. It may not."
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,"My pleasure, Captain."
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,I understand.
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,"An entrance, Captain, but no exit. They go in, but they do not  come out."
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,So I would assume.
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,"Sir, there's a multi-legged creature crawling on your shoulder."
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,"We captured four of their disrupter-type weapons, two complete  outfits of male clothing, and perhaps most important of all, one of  their communication devices."
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,"Not at this time. Its range is restricted in comparison with  ours. I may be able to alter its components, but it will take time."
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,"Spock to Enterprise, come in."
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,Is the ship all right?
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,The Captain is overdue. We've suffered no casualties among us.  This is important. Under no circumstances shall any one beam down from  the Enterprise. They'd be killed the moment they arrived.
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,The Ambassador?
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,Orbit out to maximum phaser range and stand  by for further orders. Spock out.
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,"Find the Ambassador and the Captain. Yeoman Tamula, you stay  here and prevent this young lady from immolating herself. Knock her  down if necessary. This is a killing situation. Do what you must to  protect yourself. Clear?"
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,"Please, Mister Fox. Ladies and gentlemen, please move quickly  away from the chamber or you may be injured."
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,"Practicing a peculiar variety of diplomacy, sir."
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,"I'll take you to a place of comparative safety, then I must find  the Captain."
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,"By now, Mister Ambassador, I'm sure you realise that normal  diplomatic procedures are ineffective here."
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,"Very well, sir. We need all the help we can get."
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,I had assumed you needed help. I see I'm in error.
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,"These are the attack computers,  Captain. That one's defence, that one computes the casualties. They're  all tied in with a subspace transmission unit, which keeps them in  constant contact with their Vendikan counterparts."
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,"At the moment contact is broken, it abrogates the agreement  between the two warring parties."
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,"This one's the key. The circuit is now locked. Destroy this one,  and they'll all go."
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,"There's a chance it may work, Captain."
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,"Captain, you took a big chance."
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,A feeling is not much to go on.
A  Taste of Armageddon ,"23 Feb, 1967  ",23,"Captain, you almost make me believe in luck."
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,Definitely a space vessel of some type.
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,Unknown. It could hardly be an Earth ship. There have been no  flights into this sector for years.
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,I fail to understand why it always gives you pleasure to see me  proven wrong.
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,"Much older. DY-100 class, to be exact. Captain, the last such  vessel was built centuries ago, back in the 1990s."
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,Or an old Earth ship being used by aliens.
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,"Sensor reading, Captain. Some sort of equipment functioning on  that vessel."
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,"Hull surface is pitted with meteor scars. However, scanners make  out a name. SS Botany Bay."
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,"No such vessel listed. Records of that period are fragmentary,  however. The mid=1990s was the era of your last so-called World War."
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,Of course. Your attempt to improve the race through selective  breeding.
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,Lieutenant McGivers.
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,"A strange, violent period in your history. I find no record what  so ever of an SS Botany Bay. Captain, the DY-100 class vessel was  designed for interplanetary travel only. With simple nuclear-powered  engines, star travel was considered impractical at that time. It was  ten thousand to one against their making it to another star system.  And why no record of the trip?"
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,"If you're suggesting this was a penal deportation vessel, you've  arrived at a totally illogical conclusion."
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,Your Earth was on the verge of a dark ages. Whole populations  were being bombed out of existence. A group of criminals could have  been dealt with far more efficiently than wasting one of their most  advanced spaceships.
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,"Even a theory requires some facts, Captain. So far I have none."
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,Irritation?
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,I am not capable of that emotion.
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,"Insufficient facts always invites danger, Captain."
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,"Aye, sir."
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,I note he's making considerable use of our technical library.
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,"There is that possibility, Captain. His age would be correct. In  1993, a group of these young supermen did seize power simultaneously in  over forty nations."
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,Because the scientists overlooked one fact. Superior ability  breeds superior ambition.
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,"I have collected some names and made some counts. By my  estimate, there were some eighty or ninety of these young supermen  unaccounted for when they were finally defeated."
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,Would you reveal to war-weary populations that some eighty  Napoleons might still be alive?
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,And how you managed to keep it out of the history books.
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,There was the war to end tyranny. Many considered that a noble  effort.
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,"Unify, sir? Like a team of animals under one whip?"
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,Under dozens of petty dictatorships.
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,Then your sympathies were with
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,"From 1992 through 1996, absolute ruler of more than a quarter of  your world. From Asia through the Middle East."
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,"Gentlemen, this romanticism about a ruthless dictator is"
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,And as little freedom.
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,Gentlemen.
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,Illogical.
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,"Turbo elevators inoperative. Jammed, Captain."
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,Useless. They're on override in Engineering.
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,Impossible. Intruder control systems inoperative. Mister Khan  was very thorough in his study of our tech manuals.
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,Brilliant. Every contingency anticipated.
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,"Surprised to see you, Captain, though pleased."
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,Khan is holding our staff in the briefing room. His men have  control of the ship.
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,There's a relay junction down the corridor.
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,"Quite correct, Captain. Planet number five there is habitable,  although a bit savage, somewhat inhospitable."
Space  Seed ,"16 Feb, 1967  ",24,"It would be interesting, Captain, to return to that world in a  hundred years and to learn what crop has sprung from the seed you  planted today."
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"Absolutely none, Captain. Berthold rays are such a recent  discovery. We do not yet have full knowledge of their nature. It is  known, however, that living animal tissue disintegrates under exposure.  Sandoval's group could not have survived after three years."
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,I am saying they knew there was a risk.
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,The breakdown of tissue does not develop immediately. We can  risk a limited exposure.
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"Captain, this planet is being bombarded by Berthold rays, as our  reports indicated. At this intensity, we'll be safe for a week if  necessary. But"
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"There's also no question of the fact that Berthold rays are  incontrovertibly deadly. There's no miracle connected with it, Doctor,  you know that. No cures, no serums, no antidotes. If a man is exposed  long enough, he dies."
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"Spock here, Captain. There seems to be a  total absence of life on the planet, with the exception of the  colonists and various types of flora."
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"Not at the moment, sir. I am conducting various tests with the  tricorder, but results are inconclusive."
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"Nothing. Not even insects. Yet your plants grow, and you've  survived exposure to Berthold rays."
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,Please do.
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,I have never understood the female capacity to avoid a direct  answer to any question.
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,I would like to know how your people have managed to survive  here.
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"Logically, you should all be dead."
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,Emotions are alien to me. I'm a scientist.
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,You've not yet explained the nature of this thing.
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"What you're describing was once known in the vernacular as a  happiness pill. And you, as a scientist, should know that that's not  possible."
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,Spores?
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,No.
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"No, I can't. Please, don't!"
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,I am not like you.
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"I love you. I can love you.      Captain's log, supplemental. We have been ordered  by Starfleet Command to evacuate the colony on Omicron Three. However,  the colony leader, Elias Sandoval, has refused all co-operation and  will not listen to any arguments."
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,That one looks like a dragon. You see the tail and the dorsal  spines?
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"I have. On Berengaria Seven. But I've never stopped to look at  clouds before. Or rainbows. You know, I can tell you exactly why one  appears in the sky, but considering its beauty has always been out of  the question."
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"Yes, what did you want?"
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"Yes, Captain. What did you want?"
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,I don't believe I want to tell you.
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"No, I don't think so."
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"I don't think so, sir."
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"I didn't want to, Jim."
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"There'll be no evacuation, Jim, but perhaps we should go back  and get you straightened out."
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,Very well. Come with me.
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"Mister Sulu understands, don't you, Mister Sulu?"
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,I can see the Captain is going to be difficult.
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,Almost the entire ship's complement has beamed down.
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"He went off to create something called a mint julep. That's a  drink, Jim."
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"It's impossible to say. They drifted through space until they  finally landed here. You see, they actually thrive on Berthold rays.  The plants act as a repository for thousands of microscopic spores  until they find a human body to inhabit."
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"It's a true Eden, Jim. There's belonging and love."
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"You don't understand, Jim, but you'll come around sooner or  later. Join us. Please."
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"Yes, Jim. What is it now?"
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"Wonderful, Jim. When will you beam down?"
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,Good. Leila and I will meet you at the beam  down point.
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,Spock here.
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"What's keeping you, Jim? We've been waiting."
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,Do you want me to beam up a party?
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,Just a moment. It won't take long. Do you  mind?
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"Ready to beam up, Jim."
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"The term half-breed is somewhat applicable, but computerised is  inaccurate. A machine can be computerised, not a man."
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"Jim, I don't understand."
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"Captain, if you'll excuse me."
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,My mother was a teacher. My father an ambassador.
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"Captain, please don't"
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,That's enough.
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,You did that to me deliberately.
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,The spores. They're gone. I don't belong anymore.
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"That may be correct, Captain, but trying to initiate a brawl  with over five hundred crewmen and colonists is hardly logical."
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,It can be done.
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,Captain. Striking a fellow officer is a court martial offence.
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"That is quite logical, Captain."
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,Enterprise. Spock here.
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,Yes. Yes. I'm quite well.
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"Are you still at the beam down point, and is the doctor there?"
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,Give your communicator back to Doctor McCoy.  You won't need it to beam up. It'll take a few moments. Just wait  there. Out.
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"I'll be back shortly, Captain."
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,It was necessary.
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,I can't.
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"I have a responsibility to this ship, to that man on the Bridge.  I am what I am, Leila, and if there are self-made purgatories, then we  all have to live in them. Mine can be no worse than someone else's."
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,You couldn't pronounce it.
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"They'll not hear this, of course. It'll be  more a sensation of feeling it."
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,Precisely. It should begin to work on their nerves in a few  minutes.
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,Enterprise. Spock here.
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"Just a moment. They're all beginning to call  in, Captain. Rather contritely, I should say. Sandoval wishes to speak  to you."
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"Poetry, Captain. Non-regulation."
This  Side of Paradise ,"2 Mar, 1967  ",25,"I have little to say about it, Captain, except that for the  first time in my life I was happy."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,I'm sure there is an answer. It simply has not yet been  discovered.
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"There is no current volcanic activity on this planet, Captain."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,Oh. You mean shot at it.
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,Fascinating.
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"Mister  Vanderberg, what is this?"
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"But a geological oddity, to say the least. Pure silicon?"
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"I've charted the positions of the deaths and  acts of sabotage. Here, here, and here. If the times of these incidents  are to be accepted as accurate, the creature would have to have moved  at an incredible rate of speed."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,If we could force another appearance of this creature
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"I wouldn't touch it, Captain. An extremely active corrosive.  Traces may linger."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"The same indication as shown at the door, Captain. A very strong  corrosive."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"Nothing for a device this antiquated, Captain."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,The missing pump wasn't taken by accident.  It was the one piece of equipment absolutely essential for the  operation of the reactor.
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,It would seem so.
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,I don't know. But there is a possibility.
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"Life as we know it is universally based on some combination of  carbon compounds, but what if life exists based on another element?  For instance, silicon."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"Certainly not phaser one, which is far less powerful than phaser  two."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"It could explain much, especially since the colonists are armed  only with phaser one."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,Which I could adjust to be more effective against silicon.
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"It may be, Doctor, that the creature can exist for brief periods  in such an atmosphere before returning to its own environment."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"Yes, Captain. You recall that Vanderberg commented there were  thousands of these at a lower level, the level which the machinery  opened just prior to the first appearance of the creature."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,I don't know.
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,I have already given Doctor McCoy sufficient cause for  amusement. I'd prefer to cogitate the possibilities for a time.
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"Mister Vanderberg, may I ask at which level you discovered the  nodules of silicon?"
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"Adjusting my tricorder to register for silicon, Captain.  Interesting."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"A life form, Captain. Bearing one hundred eleven degrees,  elevation four degrees."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"No, sir. Silicon."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"He never even had a chance to fire, Captain."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,Captain.   KIRK What is it?
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"This tunnel. My readings indicate it was made within the hour.  Moments ago, in fact."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,Positive.
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"Indeed, Captain. I'm quite at a loss."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,Disappeared. Astonishing that anything of that bulk could move  so rapidly.
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"Indeed. This tunnel was cut within the last two minutes.      GIOTTO Are you all right, Captain?"
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,Readings indicate a maze of tunnels of this general category in  that direction.
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"The closest approximation I could come to would be fibrous  asbestos. A mineral, Captain."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,It would seem so. Silicon-based.
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"We are dealing with a silicon creature of the deep rocks,  capable of moving through solid rock as easily as we move through the  air."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,Correct. This creature's body secretes an extremely powerful  corrosive.
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,And it explains the murdered men.
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,Or a single phaser with much longer contact.
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"I've run a complete spherical check on all life forms, radius  one hundred miles. I've located our men, all of them, and I've located  one creature moving rapidly through native rock, bearing two hundred  and one. And that is all."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"Exactly. Captain, there are literally thousands of these tunnels  in this general area alone, far too many to be cut by the one creature  in an ordinary lifetime."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"Or it is the last of a race of creatures which made these  tunnels. If so, if it is the only survivor of a dead race, to kill it  would be a crime against science."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"I see no alternative myself, Captain. It merely seems a pity.  The search team is gathering in the main tunnel."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"Gentlemen, if you'll examine your charts, please. I last located  the creature in the area marked adit26 moving in bearing two zero one.  This particular group will move out beyond that area in all directions  in an effort to surround it, and possibly capture it."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"You did not, sir. I merely thought that if the opportunity arose"
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"Very well, sir."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"II beg your pardon, sir?"
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"Is not needed there, sir. Mister Scott has far more knowledge of  nuclear reactors than I do. You're aware of that."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"Captain, there are approximately one hundred of us engaged in  this search, against one creature. The odds against you and I both  being killed are 2,228.7 to 1."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"And they are of course accurate, Captain."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"That is always my intention, Captain."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"Captain, we are being watched."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"No, sir. We're being watched."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,Captain. Fresh readings within the hour in each of these  tunnels.
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,Should we separate?
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"Yes, Captain."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,Be absolutely certain you do not damage any  of them.
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,Captain? Are you all right? Jim? Jim!
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,I could phaser you out.
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"Very well, but I find it extremely  disquieting that your roof chose that particular moment to collapse.  Please proceed with extreme caution. I shall quicken my pace."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"Captain, I just read some fresh signs."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"Where, Captain?"
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"Kill it, Captain, quickly."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"You don't dare take the chance, Captain."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"Jim, your life is in danger. You can't take  the risk."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,I remind you it's a proven killer. I'm on  my way. Spock out.
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,Fascinating. It's made no moves against you?
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"Yes, I see."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"Possibly the answer, Captain, but I'm not certain. Captain, you  are aware of the Vulcan technique of the joining of two minds."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,It's possible.
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,I'll try.
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"Pain! Pain! Pain!  That's all I got, Captain.  Waves and waves of searing pain. It's in agony."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"I don't know, Captain. Evidently, it gained an immediate  knowledge of us from its empathy with me. In my brief contact with the  creature's mind, I discovered it is a highly intelligent, extremely  sophisticated animal. In great pain, of course, because of its wound,  but not reacting at all like a wounded creature. It calls itself a  Horta."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"Captain, it has no reason to give us the device, and apparently  every reason for wishing us off this planet."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"Jim, I remind you that this is a silicon-based form of life.  Doctor McCoy's medical knowledge will be totally useless."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"To obtain that kind of communication, Captain, it will be  necessary to touch it."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,Murder. Of thousands. Devils! Eternity ends.  The chamber of the ages. The altar of tomorrow! Murderers! Stop them.  Kill!  Strike back! Monsters!
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,The end of life. Murderers.
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"Understood. It is the end of life. Eternity stops. Go out into  the tunnel. To the chamber of the ages. Cry for the children. Walk  carefully in the vault of tomorrow. Sorrow for the murdered children.  The thing you search for is there. Go. Go. Sadness.  Sadness for the end of things. Go into the tunnel. There is a  passageway. Quickly, quickly."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,It is time to sleep. It is over. Failure.  The murderers have won. Death is welcome. Let it end here.
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"Yes, Captain, eggs and about to hatch."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"There have been many generations of Horta on this planet. Every  fifty thousand years, the entire race dies, all but one, like this one,  but the eggs live. She cares for them, protects them. And when they  hatch, she is the mother to them, thousands of them. This creature here  is the mother of her race."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,And they are the most inoffensive of creatures. They harbour ill  will towards no one.
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,Except for one thing. The Horta is badly wounded. It may die.
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"It seems logical, Captain. The Horta has a very logical mind.  And after close association with humans, I find that curiously  refreshing."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"Ship ready to leave orbit, Captain. Course  laid in."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,Chief Engineer Vanderberg standing by on channel one.
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"Curious. What Chief Vanderberg said about the Horta is exactly  what the Mother Horta said to me. She found humanoid appearance  revolting, but she thought she could get used to it."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"Not specifically, but I did get the distinct impression she  found them the most attractive human characteristic of all. I didn't  have the heart to tell her that only I have"
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"Captain, the Horta is a remarkably intelligent and sensitive  creature, with impeccable taste."
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"Really, Captain, my modesty"
The  Devil In The Dark ,"9 Mar, 1967  ",26,"Captain, I see no reason to stand here and be insulted."
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,"Captain, we've reached the designated  position for scanning the coded directive tape."
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,"Strategically sound. Organia is the only Class M planet in the  disputed area, ideally located for use by either side."
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,"Inhabited by humanoids. A very peaceful, friendly people living  on a primitive level. Little of intrinsic value. Approximately Class D  minus on Richter's scale of cultures."
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,Sir?
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,"We've hit him, Captain. He's hurt."
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,"Minor, Captain. We were most fortunate. Blast damage in decks  ten and eleven, minor buckling in the antimatter pods, casualties very  light."
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,Yes. It would seem to be an unfriendly act.
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,Curious how often you humans manage to obtain that which you do  not want.
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,"With the outbreak of hostilities, that might not be easy."
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,"Negotiating with the Organians will be time-consuming, Captain,  and time is one thing we'll have the least of."
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,"Yes. Curious lack of interest. Notice the ruins in the distance,  Captain. Quite large."
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,"Whatever it is, it would seem to be inconsistent with the  reports we've been given on this culture."
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,It would seem so.
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,"Captain, if you don't mind, I should like to wander about the  village and make some studies."
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,"Captain, our information on these people and their culture was  not correct. This is not a primitive society making progress toward  mechanisation. They are totally stagnant. There is no evidence of any  progress as far back as my tricorder can register."
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,"Nevertheless, it is true. For tens of thousands of years, there  has been absolutely no advancement, no significant change in their  physical environment. This is a laboratory specimen of an arrested  culture."
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,"Negative, Captain, but it seems a logical development."
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,So it would seem. Not a very pleasant prospect.
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,"Captain, our phasers are gone."
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,"Vulcan merchants are not uncommon, Captain. It is a practical  approach."
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,"I am Spock, a dealer in kevas and trillium."
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,"Perfectly, Baroner. But it was an interesting experience."
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,"Not necessary, Commander. I understand you very well."
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,"It should not be underestimated, Captain. It reaches directly  into the mind. We Vulcans have certain mental   certain disciplines which enable me to maintain a shield. Without those  disciplines, there would be no protection."
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,"I'm sorry, sir. We did not notice you.   KLINGON"
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,"Captain, I strongly suggest we direct our energies toward the  immediate problem. Accomplishing our mission here."
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,I thought you might.
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,We'll receive no help from the Organians.
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,Verbal persuasion seems to be ineffective. Perhaps a more direct  approach?
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,You did.
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,"A very meritorious idea, Captain."
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,"I'm certain the Klingons will provide whatever is necessary.  It's a pleasure doing business with you, Mister Spock."
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,With a delayed action fuse.
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,These crates contain chemical explosives. They should make a  most satisfactory display.
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,"Six, five, four three."
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,"Our fleet will eventually arrive. In the meantime, the battle is  ours. It can be a successful one."
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,"It's no use, Jim. There's no way out."
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,"Six hours, forty three minutes, if the Klingons are punctual."
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,They do not seem to understand. Most peculiar.
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,"We may not get the chance, Captain. These walls are very thick."
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,Nor do we understand what happened to the guard at the citadel.
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,"Indeed, there are several questions I would like to ask as well."
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,"It would appear so, Captain."
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,But only two. More Organians will die.
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,"Difficult to be precise, Captain. I should say approximately  7,824.7 to 1."
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,"7,824.7 to 1."
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,I endeavour to be accurate.
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,Very good.
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,"Clear, Captain."
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,"Less than seven thousand to one, Captain. It's remarkable we've  got this far."
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,I believe you'll find that several of them  are no longer in perfect operating condition.
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,You may be premature. There are many possibilities.
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,"Inexplicable, Captain. Extreme heat. Not only the weapons but  the bodies as well."
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,Fascinating. Pure energy. Pure thought. Totally incorporeal. Not  life as we know it at all.
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,"Conventionalisations, I should say. Useless to the Organians.  Created so that visitors such as ourselves, could have conventional  points of reference."
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,We have seen it with our own eyes. I should say the Organians  are as far above us on the evolutionary scale as we are above the  amoeba.
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,You've been most restrained since we left  Organia.
Errand  of Mercy ,"23 Mar, 1967  ",27,"Captain, it took millions of years for the Organians to evolve  into what they are. Even the gods did not spring into being overnight.  You and I have no reason to be embarrassed. We did, after all, beat the  odds."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"I believe we'll have them plotted in a few more orbits, Captain."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"This is of great scientific importance, Captain. We're actually  passing through ripples in time."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"All plotted but one, Captain. Coming up on it now. Seems to be  fairly heavy displacement."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"The hypo, Captain."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,Empty.
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"Confirmed by the library record tapes, Captain. Subjects failed  to recognise acquaintances, became hysterically convinced that they  were in mortal danger, and were seeking escape at any cost. Extremely  dangerous to himself or to anyone else who might"
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"And the transporter at that time, Captain, was focused on the  centre of the time disturbance."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,And of considerable age. On the order of ten thousand centuries  old.
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"Unbelievable, Captain."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,This single object is the source of all the time displacement.
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"I can't. For this to do what it does is impossible by any  science I understand. It is operating even now. Putting out waves and  waves of time displacement, which we picked up millions of miles away."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,Incredible power. It can't be a machine as we understand  mechanics.
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,I see no reason for answers to be couched in riddles.
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"A time portal, Captain. A gateway to other times and dimensions,  if I'm correct."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,Really.
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"Relive the accident. This time be certain that the hypo accident  is avoided. Look at the speed with which the centuries are passing,  Captain. To step through on precisely the day we wish"
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,I am a fool. My tricorder is capable of recording even at this  speed. I've missed taping centuries of living history which no man  before has ever
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"With no past, no future."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"I was recording images at the time McCoy  left. A rather barbaric period in your American history. I believe I  can approximate just when to jump. Perhaps within a month of the  correct time. A week, if we're fortunate."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,There is no alternative.
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"Seconds now, sir. Stand by."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,And now.
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"It was called Depression, circa 1930. Quite barbaric."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"I'm afraid I'm going to be difficult to explain in any case,  Captain."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,That should prove interesting.
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,Fascinating.
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"Theft, Captain?"
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,You were saying you'll have no trouble explaining it.
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,Perhaps the unfortunate accident I had as a child.
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"Oh, yes, it's quite untidy. Here, let me help you."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"Captain, I hardly believe that insults are within your  prerogative as my commanding officer."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"First, I believe we have about a week before McCoy arrives, but  we can't be certain."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"There is a theory. There could be some logic to the belief that  time is fluid, like a river, with currents, eddies, backwash."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"Unless that is true, Captain, we have no hope. Frustrating.  Locked in here is the place and moment of his arrival, even the images  of what he did. If only I could tie this tricorder in with the ship's  computers for just a few moments."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,In this zinc-plated vacuum-tubed culture?
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,At what rate of payment? I need radio tubes and so forth. My  hobby.
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"Yes, of course, Captain."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,Speculation. Gifted insight.
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"We have a what, Captain?"
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,One might have said so in the first place.
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"Captain, I must have some platinum. A small block would be  sufficient, five or six pounds. By passing certain circuits through  there to be used as a duodynetic field core..."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"Captain, you're asking me to work with equipment which hardly  very far ahead of stone knives and bearskins."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"Captain. Captain, in three weeks at this rate, possibly a month,  I might reach the first mnemonic memory circuits."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"I am endeavouring, ma'am, to construct a mnemonic memory circuit  using stone knives and bearskins."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,Captain. Tools for finely detailed work.
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,I needed the fine tools for my radio work. They'd have been  returned in the morning.
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"Interesting. Where would you estimate we belong, Miss Keeler?"
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,I'll finish with the furnace.
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,I may have found our focal point in time.
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"Yes. I'm overloading those lines. I believe we'll have our  answer on this screen, Captain."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"And, Captain, you may find this a bit distressing."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,I've slowed down the recording we made from the time vortex.
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,Bad enough.
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"It would seem unlikely, Jim. A few moments ago, I read a 1930  newspaper article."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"Or Captain, Edith Keeler will die this year. I saw her obituary.  Some sort of traffic accident."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"Captain, Edith Keeler is the focal point in time we've been  looking for, the point that both we and Doctor McCoy have been drawn  to."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,Is the random element.
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,Or perhaps he prevents her from being killed. We don't know  which.
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"Captain, suppose we discover that in order to set things  straight again, Edith Keeler must die?"
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,I'll need at least two more days before I dare make another  attempt.
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"Captain, our last bit of information was obtained at the expense  of thirty hours work in fused and burned circuits."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"This is how history went after McCoy changed  it. Here, in the late 1930s. A growing pacifist movement whose  influence delayed the United States' entry into the Second World War.  While peace negotiations dragged on, Germany had time to complete its  heavy-water experiments."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"Because all this lets them develop the A-bomb first. There's no  mistake, Captain. Let me run it again. Edith Keeler. Founder of the  peace movement."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"She was right, but at the wrong time. With the A-bomb, and with  their V2 rockets to carry them, Germany captured the world."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"And all this because McCoy came back and somehow kept her from  dying in a street accident as she was meant to. We must stop him, Jim."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"We can estimate general happenings from these images, but I  can't trace down precise actions at exact moments, Captain. I'm sorry."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"Jim, Edith Keeler must die."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"Captain, I did not plan to eavesdrop."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"I must point out that when she stumbled, she might have died  right there, had you not caught her."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"We're not that sure of our facts. Who's to say when the exact  time will come? Save her, do as your heart tells you to do, and  millions will die who did not die before."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,What is it?
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"No, Jim!"
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,"He knows, Doctor. He knows."
The  City on the Edge of Forever ,"6 Apr, 1967  ",28,We were successful.
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"As I speculated, Captain, the overall pattern of mass insanity  destroying civilisations follows an almost straight line through this  section of the galaxy. Over here the Beta Portilin system the ancient  civilisations. Archaeologists have given us information indicating that  they were the beginning. Two hundred years ago, Levinius Five was swept  by mass insanity, then Theta Cygni Twelve. The last was Ingraham B, two  years ago."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"The ship is a one-man vessel of Denevan configuration, Captain.  He does not seem to be out of control. His course is straight for the  sun."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,Outer hull temperature now four hundred and eighty degrees and  rising.
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,So are we. Hull temperature one thousand degrees and rising. The  sun's gravimetric pull increasing.
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"All clear, Captain. Hull temperature falling, gravimetric pull  approaching tolerance level."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"Planet development is normal, Captain.  Originally colonised as a freighting-line base in this area."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,No Federation contacts for over a year.
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"Lieutenant Uhura has had no further response to our signals.  Sensors report the expected number of humans on the planet surface.  However, they are strangely quiet. Very little activity."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"They're here, Captain. In the buildings. Strangely quiescent."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"Captain, several people approaching."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,Indeed. They seemed most concerned for our safety.
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,Their attitude was inconsistent with their actions.
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"Captain, I understand how you must"
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"Notice the ventilator, Captain. Apparently they were trying to  keep something outside from getting in. Obviously they were not  entirely successful."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,That is correct. I am at a loss to understand it.
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"The streets are extraordinarily quiet, Captain. We've seen no  other Denevans, and the ones we stunned earlier were gone when we came  out."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,A peculiar buzzing sound. We were about to investigate it.
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"Incredible. Not only should it have been destroyed by our  phasers, it does not even register on my tricorder."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"It is not life as we know or understand it. Yet t is obviously  alive, it exists."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"Captain, I suggest we risk taking it aboard."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,No! No!
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"No, I won't."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,I must take the ship.
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,Down! I must take it down.
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,Doctor McCoy. Captain.
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"These restraints will no longer be necessary. Nor will your  sedatives, Doctor. I'll be able to return to duty. I apologise for my  weakness earlier when I tried to take control of the ship. I simply did  not understand.   What is there to understand, Mister Spock?"
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"I am a Vulcan, Doctor. Pain is a thing of the mind. The mind can  be controlled."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"It is proving to be an inconvenience, but it is manageable. And  the creature, with all of its thousands of parts, even now is  pressuring me.  It  wants this ship, but I am resisting."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"I have my own will, Captain. Let me help."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,I am a Vulcan. I am a Vulcan. There is no pain.
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,I was.
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,I have an errand on the planet's surface. You will beam me down  to the same co-ordinates as before.
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"That is an order, Mister Scott."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"Until the pain was gone, Captain. It has been discontinued by  me."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"One of the creatures will have to be captured and analysed,  Captain. We did not have a clear opportunity to do so earlier when I  was attacked. Since my nervous system is already affected, as you  pointed out, Doctor, I don't believe they can do much more to me."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"I am in complete control of myself, Doctor. The fact that I am  here proves that I do not belong in bed."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"Thank you, Captain."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"Come in, gentlemen. I believe you'll find this interesting.   Doctor, your medical skill and curiosity are quite  admirable, but I assure you I'm all right."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"Unimportant at the moment, Doctor. Please observe. Interesting,  gentlemen. A one-celled creature resembling, more than anything else, a  huge, individual brain cell."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"Do you understand what I'm suggesting, Captain?"
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"And although it is not physically connected to the other cells,  it is nevertheless part of the whole creature, guided by the whole,  drawing its strength from the whole, which probably accounts for its  unusual resistance to our phaser weapons."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"From a place where our physical laws do not apply. We may  therefore find it difficult to destroy, Captain."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"Yes, sir."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"I regret I see no other choice for you, Captain. We already know  this thing has destroyed three civilisations. Perhaps more."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"Including myself, Doctor, and Captain Kirk's young nephew.  Understandably upsetting, but once it spreads past here, there are  dozens of colonies beyond and billions of people."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,I therefore request permission to beam down to the planet's  surface. I also suggest that your nephew accompany me.
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"Captain, I do not make this request lightly. I do not know how  much longer I can hold out against the pain. But I do know what the boy  will go through should he regain consciousness."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"It exists physically. It occupies space. It has mass, therefore  gravity. It converts matter to energy."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,A possibility.
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"Yes. In essence, it can be done. A string of satellites around  the planet with burning tri-magnesite and trevium."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"Of course. The light of the sun at the proximity where the  Denevan declared himself free was one million candles per square inch.  If this works, the satellites we orbit will produce light of such  intensity that even someone in a closed, darkened area will be affected  by it."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"Captain, you'll need a host for the next step in the test to  determine whether the creature can be driven from the body. I am the  logical choice."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"There'll be none on the planet's surface, Doctor."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,The creature within me is gone. I am free of it and the pain.
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"And I'm also quite blind. An equitable trade, Doctor. Thank you."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"Interesting. Just as dogs are sensitive to certain sounds which  humans cannot hear, these creatures evidently are sensitive to light  which we cannot see."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,Doctor it was my selection as well. It is done.
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"An hereditary trait, Captain. The brightness of the Vulcan sun  has caused the development of an inner eyelid, which acts as a shield  against high-intensity light. Totally instinctive, Doctor. We tend to  ignore it, as you ignore your own appendix."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"Quite the contrary, Captain. I had a very strong reaction. My  first sight was the face of Doctor McCoy bending over me."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"My pleasure, Captain."
Operation:  Annihilate! ,"13 Apr, 1967  ",29,"Why, thank you, Doctor McCoy."
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,They may have nothing to report. Our sensors indicate no life  forms except our landing party.
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,"No cloud formations, no bodies of water, no changes in surface  temperature. Under these conditions, fog is highly unlikely, Captain.  According to our transporter co-ordinates this is the exact location  from which Jackson was beamed up to the ship."
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,"No indications of. A moment, Captain. Picking up life form  readings. Twenty four degrees mark seven. Range one thirty seven point  one six metres. Multiple readings, Captain."
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,"No change, Captain."
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,"Very bad poetry, Captain."
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,What we've just seen is not real.
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,"However, on azimuth twenty four, at just over one hundred  metres, there are definitely life forms. Erratic, confused, but  definitely registering."
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,"This is the source of the life form readings, Captain. They're  inside, somewhere."
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,"I would say not, Captain. There's no indication of anything that  would cause such interference."
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,Nor do our sensors register the life forms inside.
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,"Trick or treat, Captain?"
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,That would seem to be in order.
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,The readings would so indicate.
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,"Yes. I am undamaged, Captain."
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,"I do not know, Captain, but these things do exist. They are  real."
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,As if someone knew what it was that terrifies man most on an  instinctive level.
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,Neither did Jackson just before he collapsed.
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,Mapping expeditions have charted this solar system before. There  never have been any life forms on Pyris Seven.
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,There are ancient Earth legends about wizards and their  familiars.
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,Demons in animal forms sent by Satan to serve the wizard.
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,"I do not create the legend, Captain. I merely report it."
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,Ingenious.
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,Mind probing? Hypnosis?
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,Telepathy?
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,"Not entirely, no. Telepathy doesn't imply control and I assure  you that I have full control over your friends."
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,"Twenty two minutes, seventeen seconds."
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,"I'm sure we'll find out shortly. Jim, all of these things that  we've seen. To an Earthman like yourself, they must seem quite  familiar."
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,"Precisely. I refer you to the psychological theory of the racial  subconscious. The universal myths, symbols."
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,And dungeons and castles and black cats. They all belong to the  twilight world of consciousness.
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,And they missed. They reached basically only the subconscious.  Korob seemed  puzzled by your reaction to the environment he'd provided.
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,And not to have a knowledge of our scientific methods is most  unlikely for any life form we've met in this galaxy.
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,Evidently something totally alien in all respects.
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,"I, too, am at a loss at this time to suggest a course of action."
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,You came in a ship?
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,Fascinating.
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,"Racial memories. The cat is the most ruthless, most terrifying  of animals, as far back as the sabre-toothed tiger."
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,"Ready when you are, Captain."
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,"Quickly, Captain."
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,"Captain, a bit more alacrity, if you please."
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,Captain.
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,Jim!
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,"Fortuitous, Captain. And now that we have them all together?   A most unpleasant situation, Captain. If only your  phaser had some power."
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,"Don't let her touch the wand, Captain."
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,Jim!
Catspaw ,"27 Oct, 1967  ",30,Fascinating. A life form totally alien to our galaxy. If we  could preserve and study this
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,"We have reached projected point three, Captain. Adjust to new  course two oh one mark one five."
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,Captain.
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,"Will you check your automatic scanner, please?"
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,Nor have I.
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,Heading directly toward us at warp speed.
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,"Vaguely like a cloud of ionised hydrogen, but with strong  erratic electrical impulses."
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,"Helm does not answer, Captain."
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,"Cut, Captain."
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,"Now on course nine eight mark one two, heading directly toward  Gamma Canaris region."
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,"Gravity is similar to Earth. Most unusual in view of its size.  The bulk of the body seems to be iron and nickel. More than an  asteroid. Like a small planetoid, I should say. Possibly a remnant of a  planet breakup. Totally suitable for human life."
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,"Most unusual. Unlikely. In fact, Captain, I would say quite  impossible."
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,Precisely.
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,Obviously.
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,The ionised cloud.
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,Fascinating.
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,Correct.
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,Which seems to be on the surface of this body at the moment.
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,You say we'll be unable to get the ship to function again?
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,You don't mind if we continue to try?
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,"You built this, Mister Cochrane?"
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,Not bad.
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,"Captain, Doctor."
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,"We imagined nothing, Mister Cochrane. There was an entity out  there and I suspect it was the same entity which brought us here.  Please explain."
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,You were injured?
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,"I prefer to reserve judgment on that part of your story, sir.  Meanwhile, would you please explain exactly what this Companion of  yours is?"
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,"The name of Zefram Cochrane is revered throughout the known  galaxy. Planets were named after him. Great universities, cities."
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,"True, his body was never found."
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,"If so, you wear your age very well."
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,"Captain. These instruments, they date from the time indicated.  From your ship, Mister Cochrane?"
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,You ask me to find a weapon. Do you intend to destroy it?
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,"Quite clear, Captain."
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,"Yes. Quite all right, Doctor. A most fascinating thing happened.  Apparently, the Companion imparted to me a rather quaint, old-fashioned  electric shock of respectable voltage."
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,"Evidently. Unquestionably, a large part of its substance is  simple electricity."
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,"Quite correct, Doctor."
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,"Put this in the proximity of the Companion, throw this switch,  and it will scramble every electrical impulse the creature can produce.  It cannot fail."
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,We may simply render it powerless.
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,"There is some risk, Captain. We do not know the extent of its  powers."
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,All right.
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,"Yes, Captain?"
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,The translator is for use with more congruent life forms.
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,It is possible. If I could widen its pattern of reception
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,Then it translates its findings into English.
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,"Quite ready, Captain."
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,Yes. The matter of gender could change the entire situation.
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,Then it is not a zookeeper.
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,"This is a marvellous opportunity to add to our knowledge. Ask it  about its nature, its history."
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,A chance like this may never come again. It could tell us so  much.
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,"Her attitude when she approaches you is profoundly different  than when she contacts us. Her appearance is soft, gentle. Her voice is  melodic, pleasing. I do not totally understand the emotion, but it  obviously exists. The Companion loves you."
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,"Your highly emotional reaction is most illogical. Your  relationship with the Companion has for one hundred and fifty years  been emotionally satisfying,  eminently practical, and totally harmless. It may indeed have been  quite beneficial."
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,Fascinating. A totally parochial attitude.
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,"But she or it is inhuman, Captain. You cannot expect her to  react like a human."
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,"Companion, you do not have the power to create life."
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,Commissioner Hedford was dying.
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,"Then you are both here, in the one body?"
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,"Not coming from a human being. You are, after all, essentially  irrational."
Metamorphosis ,"10 Nov, 1967  ",31,"But you will age, both of you. There will be no immortality.  You'll both grow old here and finally die."
Friday's  Child ,"1 Dec, 1967  ",32,"Ordinarily, under these circumstances, I would recommend a  large, well-armed landing party."
Friday's  Child ,"1 Dec, 1967  ",32,He also mentioned that they can be highly dangerous.
Friday's  Child ,"1 Dec, 1967  ",32,"Inefficient, however. Emotion, Captain."
Friday's  Child ,"1 Dec, 1967  ",32,"It would appear, Captain, that he finds you a disappointment."
Friday's  Child ,"1 Dec, 1967  ",32,"Our check-in signal is one hour, twelve minutes overdue. Since  no reconnaissance party has appeared, and since Mister Scott is notably  efficient in such matters"
Friday's  Child ,"1 Dec, 1967  ",32,That would seem a logical conclusion.
Friday's  Child ,"1 Dec, 1967  ",32,"Yes, Captain, an excellent idea."
Friday's  Child ,"1 Dec, 1967  ",32,"But a defensible entrance, Captain."
Friday's  Child ,"1 Dec, 1967  ",32,"The walls get higher and narrower, but there is a way out."

Friday's  Child ,"1 Dec, 1967  ",32,"If by that you mean we can't expect help from the Enterprise, I  must agree."

Who  Mourns For Adonais? ,"22 Sep, 1967  ",33,Progress report.
Who  Mourns For Adonais? ,"22 Sep, 1967  ",33,"Speed is essential, Lieutenant."
Who  Mourns For Adonais? ,"22 Sep, 1967  ",33,"I can think no one better equipped to handle it, Miss Uhura.  Please proceed."
Who  Mourns For Adonais? ,"22 Sep, 1967  ",33,"Progress, Mister Sulu?"
Who  Mourns For Adonais? ,"22 Sep, 1967  ",33,Continue the search.
Who  Mourns For Adonais? ,"22 Sep, 1967  ",33,Mister Kyle.
Who  Mourns For Adonais? ,"22 Sep, 1967  ",33,"We're unable to break completely loose from this force field,  but we might be able to punch some holes through it."
Who  Mourns For Adonais? ,"22 Sep, 1967  ",33,To shoot through. It might also relieve Lieutenant Uhura's  communications problem. Take these equations to the nuclear electronics  lab. I want them to work on the problem of negating the force field in  selected areas. That might be done by generating a strong pinpoint  charge of M-rays on some of these selected wave lengths and tying them  in with the combined output of all our engines.
Who  Mourns For Adonais? ,"22 Sep, 1967  ",33,"Spock here, Captain."
Who  Mourns For Adonais? ,"22 Sep, 1967  ",33,Is there a structure of some sort near you?
Who  Mourns For Adonais? ,"22 Sep, 1967  ",33,"We can negate sections of it, creating  openings through which we can fire our phaser banks."
Who  Mourns For Adonais? ,"22 Sep, 1967  ",33,Captain. I would recommend a discreet  distance.
Who  Mourns For Adonais? ,"22 Sep, 1967  ",33,Sensors are picking up an atmospheric  disturbance in your area.
Who  Mourns For Adonais? ,"22 Sep, 1967  ",33,More power to the shields.
Who  Mourns For Adonais? ,"22 Sep, 1967  ",33,All banks maintain firing rate.
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,"Captain, I should like to request a leave of absence on my home  planet. On our present course you can divert to Vulcan with a loss of  but two point eight light days."
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,"I have made my request, Captain. All I require from you is that  you answer it. Yes or no."
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,It is undignified for a woman to play servant to a man who is  not hers.
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,"You have my request, Captain. Will you grant it or not?"
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,"Captain, surely I have enough leave time accumulated."
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,"No. Nothing of that nature, Captain."
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,No! I must. I wish to take my leave on Vulcan.
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,I need rest. I'm asking you to accept that answer.
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,"Thank you, Captain."
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,"No.  We're not.   Captain's log, stardate 3372.7. On course, on  schedule, bound for Altair Six via Vulcan. First Officer Spock seems to  be under stress. He has requested and been granted shore leave. Ship  surgeon McCoy has him under medical surveillance."
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,"I quite understand, Captain."
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,Changed the course?
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,"No. No, by no means, Captain. It is quite possible."
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,"Captain, I accept on your word that I did it, but I do not know  why, nor do I remember doing it. Captain, lock me away. I do not wish  to be seen. I cannot. No Vulcan could explain further."
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,Ask me no further questions. I will not answer.
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,Sickbay?
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,"My orders were to report to Sickbay, Doctor. I have done so. And  now I'll go to my quarters."
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,"Examine me, for all the good it'll do either of us."
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,Come.
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,"It is a thing no out-worlder may know except those very few who  have been involved. A Vulcan understands, but even we do not speak of  it among ourselves. It is a deeply personal thing. Can you see that,  Captain, and understand?"
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,"Captain, there are some things which transcend even the  discipline of the service."
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,It has to do with biology.
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,Biology.
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,Vulcan biology.
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,"The birds and the bees are not Vulcans, Captain. If they were,  if any creature as proudly logical as us were to have their logic  ripped from them as this time does to us. How do Vulcans choose their  mates? Haven't you wondered?"
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,"No. No. It is not. We shield it with ritual and customs shrouded  in antiquity. You humans have no conception. It strips our minds from  us. It brings a madness which rips away our veneer of civilisation. It  is the pon farr. The time of mating. There are precedents in nature,  Captain. The giant eelbirds of Regulus Five, once each eleven years  they must return to the caverns where they hatched.  On your Earth, the salmon. They must return to that one stream where  they were born, to spawn or die in trying."
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,"No. Nor am I a man. I'm a Vulcan. I'd hoped I would be spared  this, but the ancient drives are too strong. Eventually, they catch up  with us, and we are driven by forces we cannot control to return home  and take a wife. Or die."
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,Let me alone. Let me alone!
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,Miss Chapel.
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,"I had a most startling dream. You were trying to tell me  something, but I couldn't hear you. It would be illogical for us to  protest against our natures. Don't you think?"
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,Your face is wet.
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,Vulcan. Miss Chapel.
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,"Yes, I know, Christine. Would you make me some of that plomeek  soup?"
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,"It is obvious that you have surmised my problem, Doctor. My  compliments on your insight. Captain, there is a thing that happens to  Vulcans at this time. Almost an insanity, which you would no doubt find  distasteful."
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,Then would you beam down to the planet's surface and stand with  me? There is a brief ceremony.
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,"It is my right. By tradition, the male is accompanied by his  closest friends."
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,I also request McCoy accompany me.
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,This is Spock.
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,"T'Pring, parted from me and never parted, never and always  touching and touched. We meet at the appointed place.   T'PRING : Spock, parted from me and never parted, never  and always touching and touched. I await you."
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,She is T'Pring. My wife.
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,"This is the land of my family. It has been held by us for more  than two thousand  Earth years. This is our place of Koon-ut-kal-if-fee,"
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,The marriage party approaches. I hear them.
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,"By our parents' arrangement. A ceremony while we were but seven  years of age. Less than a marriage but more than a betrothal.  One touches the other in order to feel each other's thoughts. In this  way our minds were locked together, so that at the proper time, we  would both be drawn to Koon-ut-kal-if-fee."
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,They are not outworlders. They are my friends. I am permitted  this.
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,This is Kirk.
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,"With my life, T'Pau.   T'PAU: What they are about to see comes down from the time of the  beginning, without change. This is the Vulcan heart. This is the Vulcan  soul. This is our way. Kah-if-farr.      T'PRING: Kal-if-fee!"
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,T'Pau.   T'PAU: Thee speaks?
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,"My friend does not understand.   T'PAU: The choice has been made, Spock. It is up to him now."
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,"He does not know. I will do what I must, T'Pau, but not with  him! His blood does not burn. He is my friend!   T'PAU: It is said thy Vulcan blood is thin. Are thee Vulcan or are thee  human?"
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,"I burn, T'Pau. My eyes are flame. My heart is flame. Thee has  the power, T'Pau. In the name of my fathers, forbid. Forbid! T'Pau. I  plead with thee! I beg!   T'PAU: Thee has prided thyself on thy Vulcan heritage. It is decided."
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,Yes. I'll follow you up in a few minutes. You will instruct  Mister Chekov to plot a course for the nearest Starbase where I must  surrender myself to the authorities.  T'Pring. Explain.   T'PRING: Specify.
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,"Why the challenge, and why you chose my captain as your  champion.   T'PRING: Stonn wanted me, I wanted him."
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,"I see no logic in preferring Stonn over me.   T'PRING: You have become much known among our people, Spock. Almost a  legend. And as the years went by, I came to know that I did not want to  be the consort of a legend. But by the laws of our people, I could only  divorce you by the kal-if-fee. There was also Stonn, who wanted very  much to be my  consort, and I wanted him. If your Captain were victor, he would not  want me, and so I would have Stonn. If you were victor you would free  me because I had dared to challenge, and again I would have Stonn. But  if you did not free me, it would be the same. For you would be gone,  and I would have your name and your property, and Stonn would still be  there."
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,Logical. Flawlessly logical.   T'PRING: I am honoured.
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,"Stonn. She is yours. After a time, you may find that having is  not so pleasing a thing after all as wanting. It is not logical, but it  is often true. Spock here. Stand by to beam up. Live long, T'Pau, and  prosper.   T'PAU: Live long and prosper, Spock."
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,I shall do neither. I have killed my captain and my friend.  Energize.
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,"Doctor, I shall be resigning my commission  immediately, of course."
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,So I would appreciate your making the final arrangements.
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,"Doctor, please, let me finish. There can be no excuse for the  crime of which I'm guilty. I intend to offer no defence. Furthermore, I  shall order Mister Scott to take immediate command of this vessel."
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,Captain! Jim!
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,"I'm pleased to see you, Captain. You seem uninjured. I am at  something of a loss to understand it, however."
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,Indeed.
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,"Ah, yes, the girl. Most interesting. It must have been the  combat. When I thought I had killed the captain, I found I had lost all  interest in T'Pring. The madness was gone."
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,Merely my quite logical relief that Starfleet had not lost a  highly proficient captain.
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,"Thank you, Captain."
Amok Time ,"15 Sep, 1967  ",34,"Thank you, Doctor."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Captain, sensors show this entire solar system has been  destroyed. Nothing left but rubble and asteroids."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Nonetheless, Captain, sensors show nothing but debris where we  charted seven planets last year."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Captain, the two inner most planets of this system appear to be  intact."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"I have it on the sensors, Captain. By configuration, a starship  stopped in space. She appears to be drifting."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,Sensors not recording normal energy output.
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,She may have been wrecked by whatever destroyed these solar  systems.
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"All power plants dead, reserve energy banks operative at a very  low power level."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,Also operative at a low power level. The entire Bridge is  damaged and uninhabitable. The rest of the ship seems able to sustain  life.
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Normal, but subspace interference makes readings difficult."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,Acknowledged.
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Improbable, Captain. The surface temperature of the inner planet  is that of molten lead. The other has an atmosphere poisonous to human  life."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,Unable to raise Starfleet Command due to  heavy subspace interference.
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"She was attacked by what appears to be  essentially a robot, an automated weapon of immense size and power. Its  apparent function is to smash planets to rubble and then digest the  debris for fuel. It is, therefore, self-sustaining  as long as there are planetary bodies for it to feed on."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Unknown, Captain. However, Mister Sulu has  computed the path of the machine, using the destroyed solar systems as  a base course.  Projecting back on our star charts, we find that it came from outside,  from another galaxy."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"If it follows its present path, it will go through the most  densely populated section of our galaxy."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"It came up on us fast, Captain, but we seem  able to maintain our distance."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,It looks very much like Commodore Decker's planet killer. And it  is pursuing us.
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"We are more manoeuvrable, but it is gaining on us. Sensors  indicate some kind of total conversion drive."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"I would say none, Captain. The energy  generated by our power nacelles seems to attracts it. I doubt we could  manoeuvre close enough without drawing a direct attack upon ourselves."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Closing, Captain."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Evasive action, Mister Sulu."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Damage report, all stations."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Affect repairs. Captain Kirk, come in please."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Captain, we've been attacked. The transporter is damaged. We're  taking evasive action."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"We have outrun it, Doctor."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Impulse and warp engines operative, transporter and  communications under repair. Random chance seems to have operated in  our favour."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"I believe I said that, Doctor."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,Evidently programmed to ignore anything as small as a ship  beyond a certain radius. We'll maintain a discreet distance and circle  back to pick up the Captain.
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"I am aware of the Rigel system's population, Commodore, but we  are only one ship. Our deflector shields are strained, our subspace  transmitter is useless. Logically, our primary duty is to survive in  order to warn Starfleet Command."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Mister Sulu, you will lay in an evasive course back to the  Constellation."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"You will carry out my last order, Mister Sulu."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"You have the right to do so, but I would advise against it."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"You tried to destroy it once before, Commodore. The result was a  wrecked ship and a dead crew."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,Sensors show the object's hull is solid neutronium. A single  ship cannot combat it.
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Unfortunately, Starfleet Order 104, Section B, leaves me no  alternative. Paragraph 1A clearly states"
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"If you can certify Commodore Decker medically or psychologically  unfit for command, I can relieve him under Section C."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,You'll also be asked to produce your medical records to prove  it.
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,Then your statement would not be considered valid.
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,Deflector shields at full power. They can't take much more of  this.
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Deflectors holding, but weakening. We must retreat, Commodore.  The energy drain"
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Commodore, I urgently recommend immediate withdrawal."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Sir, deflector shields are gone."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"It has ceased fire. We're being held in a tractor beam. We're  being pulled inside, Commodore. You must veer off."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"We have lost warp power. If we don't break the tractor beam  within sixty seconds, we never will."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"That, sir, is illogical. It is suicide. Attempted suicide would  be proof that you are psychologically unfit for command. If you don't  veer off, I shall relieve you on that basis."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,Emergency impulse power.
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,We need more power.
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,It's closing fast on the Constellation.
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Commodore, I suggest"
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,This machine seems to have a programmed defensive sphere. Any  energy source entering that field is subject to attack.
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,Warp drive and deflectors will be out for a solar day. Repairs  proceeding on transporter and communications.
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"We can maintain this speed for only seven hours before we  exhaust our fuel, but it can refuel itself indefinitely."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Illogical. We cannot destroy it. Therefore, we cannot save  Rigel. We must transport the Captain and the others from the  Constellation  and escape this thing's subspace interference in order to warn  Starfleet Command."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,Can you raise Starfleet?
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"On audio, Lieutenant."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,Commodore.
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,Warp drive out. Deflector shields down. Transporter under  repair. We are on emergency impulse power.
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"At our present rate of consumption, we'll  exhaust our impulse power long before then."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Commodore Decker, you are relieved of  command."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"You may file a formal protest with Starfleet Command, assuming  we survive to reach a Starbase. But you are relieved. Commodore. I do  not wish to place you under arrest."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,Vulcans never bluff.
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Captain, I have assumed command."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"One moment, sir. Commodore. I believe you are scheduled for  medical examination. Mister Montgomery."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,You will accompany the commodore to Sickbay.
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Mister Sulu, change course. Seven zero mark two one."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Captain, we are taking an evasive course back to you. We will  try to stay ahead of the object until we can transport you aboard."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Shut them, Mister Sulu."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Whoever it is, Captain, has no  authorisation. Lieutenant, raise the shuttlecraft."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Commodore, I must insist that you return to  the ship."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"You cannot succeed, Commodore. Your only  logical alternative is to return to the ship."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"He's gone. Constellation, come in, please."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Sir, may I offer my condolences on the death  of your friend. It is most regrettable."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"The drop in power is definite, Captain but negligible. The  object is still pursing us, thereby causing us to drain our power  reserve at a much greater rate."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Transporter operational, Captain. Shall we beam you aboard?"
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,There's little to be gained by staying aboard the Constellation.
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,Acknowledged. Transporter Room. Beam damage  control party aboard.
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"No, sir. Ninety seven point eight three five  megatons."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Negative, Captain. Its hull is pure  neutronium. There is no known way of blasting through it."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,Insufficient data. I shall try to take  further sensor readings.
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,The object's neutronium hull makes sensor  readings of the inner mechanism impossible.
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Captain, you're getting dangerously close to  the planet killer."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Jim, you'll be killed, just like Decker."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,Your chances of survival are not promising.  We don't even know if the explosion will be powerful enough.
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,Thirty seconds is very slim timing.
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Transporter is out, Captain. You'll have to  stand by."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Captain, transporter operational, but just barely."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Transporter, stand by."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,Energise.
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Mister Scott, twenty seconds to detonation."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,Mister Scott
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,Energy output zero. Radiation level normal.
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Welcome aboard, Captain. Sensors show all energy sources  deactivated. It's quite dead."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Indeed, Captain. I presume your log will show that Commodore  Decker died in the line of duty."
The  Doomsday Machine ,"20 Oct, 1967  ",35,"Appropriate, Captain. However, I can't help wondering if there  are any more of those weapons wandering around the universe."

Wolf  In The Fold ,"22 Dec, 1967  ",36,Acknowledged. Co-ordinates received.
Wolf  In The Fold ,"22 Dec, 1967  ",36,"Concerning the situation you related to us.  In my opinion, the Argelian empathic contact is an interesting  phenomenon, but the technique is not sound enough to risk a man's life."
Wolf  In The Fold ,"22 Dec, 1967  ",36,Simply that we beam Mister Scott on board  the Enterprise and employ our computers to learn the truth.
Wolf  In The Fold ,"22 Dec, 1967  ",36,"Quite clear, Captain."
Wolf  In The Fold ,"22 Dec, 1967  ",36,"Anger is a relative state, sir. Were you angry enough to do  violence?"
Wolf  In The Fold ,"22 Dec, 1967  ",36,"Sensitivity of certain Argelian women is a documented fact,  Captain."

Wolf  In The Fold ,"22 Dec, 1967  ",36,"Which would tend to support the proposition that the murderer  was not human. Deriving sustenance from emotion is not unknown in the  galaxy, and fear is among the strongest and most violent of the  emotions."
Wolf  In The Fold ,"22 Dec, 1967  ",36,"Computer, digest log recordings for past five solar minutes.  Correlate hypotheses. Compare with life forms register. Question. Could  such an entity within discussed limits exist in this galaxy?"
Wolf  In The Fold ,"22 Dec, 1967  ",36,"Computer, extrapolate most likely composition of such entity."
Wolf  In The Fold ,"22 Dec, 1967  ",36,"Working. To meet with specified requirements, entity would exist  without form in conventional sense. Most probable mass of energy  of highly cohesive electromagnetic field."
Wolf  In The Fold ,"22 Dec, 1967  ",36,I point out that Jack the Ripper slew at will in the heart of  the most populous city of old Earth  and was never identified.
Wolf  In The Fold ,"22 Dec, 1967  ",36,"I suggest the possibility of a hypnotic screen, which blinds all  but the victim to the presence of the killer."
Wolf  In The Fold ,"22 Dec, 1967  ",36,"And I suspect preys on women because women are more easily and  more deeply terrified, generating more sheer horror than the male of  the species."
Wolf  In The Fold ,"22 Dec, 1967  ",36,"Captain, those places are aligned directly between Argelius and  Earth."
Wolf  In The Fold ,"22 Dec, 1967  ",36,"I can appreciate your position, sir. You are in charge of civil  disturbances locally. If you are the entity for which we search, what  better position from which to kill with impunity?"
Wolf  In The Fold ,"22 Dec, 1967  ",36,"An entity which feeds on fear and terror would find a perfect  hunting ground on Argelius, a planet without violence, where the  inhabitants are as peaceful as sheep. The entity would be as a hungry  wolf in that fold."
Wolf  In The Fold ,"22 Dec, 1967  ",36,Computer. Report on analysis of Exhibit A.
Wolf  In The Fold ,"22 Dec, 1967  ",36,Specify. Point of origin.
Wolf  In The Fold ,"22 Dec, 1967  ",36,The computer will not respond to these controls. The entity is  unquestionably controlling it.
Wolf  In The Fold ,"22 Dec, 1967  ",36,"It's no use, Captain. The bypass circuits are blocked."
Wolf  In The Fold ,"22 Dec, 1967  ",36,"Indeed, it will try, but not immediately. We know it feeds on  fear and terror. There are nearly four hundred and forty humans aboard  this ship. Surely it will try to breed fear and terror before it kills."
Wolf  In The Fold ,"22 Dec, 1967  ",36,"Yes we do, Captain, but with the entity in control"
Wolf  In The Fold ,"22 Dec, 1967  ",36,Indeed. If we could focus the attention of the computer on one  of them.
Wolf  In The Fold ,"22 Dec, 1967  ",36,Apparently our friends learned very quickly.
Wolf  In The Fold ,"22 Dec, 1967  ",36,Freefall!
Wolf  In The Fold ,"22 Dec, 1967  ",36,"We don't have much time, Captain."
Wolf  In The Fold ,"22 Dec, 1967  ",36,"Normal environmental levels have been restored, Captain, but it  will not last long. A few hours at best."
Wolf  In The Fold ,"22 Dec, 1967  ",36,"Proceeding, Captain, but I will need some time."
Wolf  In The Fold ,"22 Dec, 1967  ",36,"It is attempting to generate terror, Captain."
Wolf  In The Fold ,"22 Dec, 1967  ",36,Ready.
Wolf  In The Fold ,"22 Dec, 1967  ",36,"Computer, this is a Class A compulsory directive. Compute to the  last digit the value of pi."
Wolf  In The Fold ,"22 Dec, 1967  ",36,"As we know, the value of pi is a transcendental figure without  resolution. The computer banks will work on this problem to the  exclusion of all else until we order it to stop."
Wolf  In The Fold ,"22 Dec, 1967  ",36,"There is resistance, Captain, but the directive is succeeding.  Bank after bank is turning to the problem."
Wolf  In The Fold ,"22 Dec, 1967  ",36,"Complete computer control, Captain. The entity has fled."
Wolf  In The Fold ,"22 Dec, 1967  ",36,"Possibly, Doctor. Its consciousness may continue for some time,  consisting of billions of separate bits of energy, floating forever in  space, powerless."
Wolf  In The Fold ,"22 Dec, 1967  ",36,"Captain, since you came to Argelius to rest, I suggest you take  advantage of the opportunity."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,Captain. They will not answer. The long-range sensor sweep of  this system reveals no sign of life.
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"I register no life readings at all, sir."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"We would have known in advance of any system-wide catastrophe,  and in the event of an interplanetary war, there would be considerable  radioactive residue. Our instruments show only normal background  radiation."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"Unknown, sir. Sensor readings would have revealed the presence  of any disease organisms. They do not. In addition, we received the  routine report from this system only a week ago. Even the Symbalene  blood burn does not act that swiftly."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"An extremely powerful bolt of energy, Captain."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"Temporarily, Captain. Our shields absorbed energy equivalent to  ninety of our photon torpedoes."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"I may add, the energy used repulsing this first attack reduced  our shielding power twenty percent."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,We can resist three more such attacks. The fourth will shatter  our shields completely.
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"Approximately warp fifteen, Captain."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"Unknown, Captain. Nothing within sensor range.  Something now, Captain. Very small. Bearing one two three  degrees, mark one eight. Range ninety thousand kilometres."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"No, sir. Holding steady."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,No effect. Target absorbed full energy of our torpedo.
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"They are in good working order, Captain."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"Captain, shields are down. We cannot survive another hit."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"Computing now, Captain. Weight, five hundred kilograms. Shape,  roughly cylindrical. Length, a fraction over one metre."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"Intelligence does not necessarily require bulk, Mister Scott."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"Captain, this message is a sort of binary. Extremely  sophisticated, compressed, carrying several channels at once."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"No clue as yet, Captain. A moment. Transmission speed has  stepped down. Much slower. Seems to be a single binary."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,Fascinating.
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"It would seem so, Captain."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"It's a formula, Captain. They're sending us a mathematical  message and requesting language equivalence. They're trying to  communicate."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"Cut power, Lieutenant. Overloaded and burned out."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,Nomad?
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"Negative, Captain. It has a protective screen. I cannot get  through."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,A reasonable course.
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,It is reacting much like a highly sophisticated computer.
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"An opinion is a belief, a view, a judgment."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,Yes. It was reported destroyed. There were no more in the  series. But if this is that probe
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"Chart 14A, sir?"
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,I believe the history computer can answer that question. I'll  have the readout in a moment.
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,The usage is correct. The creator was simply testing your memory  banks.
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"I've correlated all the available information on the Nomad  probe, and I'm convinced that this object is indeed that probe."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,True.
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,Presumed destroyed by a meteor collision. I submit that it was  badly damaged and somehow managed to repair itself.
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"This is the creator of Nomad, perhaps the  most brilliant though erratic scientist of his time. His dream was to  build a perfect thinking machine, capable of independent logic. You  recall his name."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"Yes. Similar. Captain, I believe that Nomad thinks you are  Roykirk. That may well be why the attack was broken off. It responded  to your name as well as its damaged memory banks permitted."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"Essentially it is, Doctor. I believe that more happened to it  than just damage in the meteor collision. It mentioned the other. The  unanswered question is, the other what?   Nomad was a thinking machine, the best that could be engineered. It was  a prototype."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"Precisely, Doctor. And somehow that programming has been  changed. It would seem that Nomad is now seeking out perfect  life-forms, perfection being measured by its own relentless logic."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"Captain, Mister Singh reports that Nomad is no longer in the  auxiliary control room."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,That unit is a woman.
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"Nomad, I have arranged the tapes for flash feed at the top speed  of the computer. Please do not draw the information faster than the  machine's capacity."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,Fascinating.
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"Well, Doctor?"
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"Captain, if that is correct, if there has been no brain damage  but only knowledge erased, she could be re-educated."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,Does the creator wish Nomad to wait elsewhere?
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"Doctor, I interrupted you because Nomad would not have  understood your anger. It has great technical skill, but its reaction  to emotion is unpredictable. It almost qualifies as a life-form."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"The study of it would be of great use, Captain."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"Yes, sir."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"An almost human stubbornness, Captain. I have been unable to  convince Nomad to lower its screens for analysis. Without its  co-operation, I can do nothing."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,Thank you.
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"It is not sufficient, Captain. I get certain  references to the accident, the other, but nothing clear. There are  areas I simply cannot scan."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"Captain, I suggest the Vulcan mind probe."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,It seems the only way.
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"There is a risk, but I have formed a partial hypothesis. I must  check it out."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"I. Am. Nomad. I am performing my function. Deep emptiness, It  approaches. Collision. Damage. Blackness. I. Am. The other. I am Tan  Ru, Tan Ru. Nomad. Tan Ru. Error. Flaw. Imperfection. Must sterilise.  Rebirth. We are complete. Much power. Gun ta. Noo. Icka. Tan Ru. The  creator instructs. Search out. Identify. Sterilise imperfections. We  are Nomad.  We are Nomad. We are complete. We are instructed. Our purpose is clear.  Sterilise imperfections.  Sterilise imperfections.  Nomad. Sterilise. Sterilise. Nomad, sterilise,"
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"Fascinating, Captain. The knowledge. The depth."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"It was, it was damaged in deep space. Undoubtedly, the meteor  collision. Its memory banks were destroyed, or most of them. It  wandered without purpose, and then it met the other. The other was an  alien probe of great power. Somehow they merged,  repaired each other, became one."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"Not the Nomad we lost from Earth. It took from the other a new  directive to replace its own. The other was originally programmed to  secure and sterilise soil samples from other planets, probably as a  prelude to colonisation."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,I beg your pardon?
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,And that is the only thing that has saved us until now.   Yes.
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,Captain. I've examined the brig. The forcefield door on the  security cell is damaged and the guards have vanished. I must assume  they are dead.
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"I suspect it is about to re-evaluate its creator. Captain, it  may have been unwise to admit to Nomad that you are a biological unit.  In Nomad's eyes, you must now undoubtedly appear imperfect."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"Even worse. Nomad just now made a reference to its launch point,  Earth."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,I do not believe there is much beyond Nomad's capabilities.
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,It will find the Earth infested with imperfect biological units.
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,No response.   (The doors open and Nomad comes out.
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"Since it specifically examined your history, I suggest it has  completed its re-evaluation."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,Undoubtedly.
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"Your logic was impeccable, Captain. We are in grave danger."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"My congratulations, Captain. A dazzling  display of logic."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"No, sir."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,Remarkable.
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,"The destruction of Nomad was a great waste, Captain. It was a  remarkable instrument."
The  Changeling ,"29 Sep, 1967  ",37,Sir?
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"The soil here is remarkably rich and fertile, Captain. Husbandry  would be quite efficacious."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"Oh, quite sure. Readings indicate the entire planet is covered  with growth like this.  Curious, even at the poles there's very little variation in temperature  which maintains a planet-wide average of seventy six degrees."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"I find that most unusual, Captain."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,Indeed. Subsurface vibrations for miles in all directions.
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"Quite strong, fairly regular, artificially produced."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,Captain.
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"There's a humanoid hiding directly behind us, moving with  remarkable agility, bearing one eight."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"A visitor. One wanting to retain his anonymity, I should say."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,Anything?
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"Interesting. Extremely low specific gravity, some uraninite,  hornblende, quartz.  Fragile, good cleavage. An  analysis should prove interesting."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"Obviously highly unstable, Captain. This could be a find of some  importance. In large quantities, it could be a considerable source of  power."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"If Scott is correct about the force from the surface, it may  have to do with the vibrations I read earlier."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"If so, an immense one. Probably subterranean."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,Jim!
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"Doctor McCoy's potion is acting like all his potions, turning my  stomach. Other than that, I am quite well."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"I surmised you were unaware of that plant, so I"
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"I assure you, Captain, I had no intention of doing that. It was  merely my own clumsiness prevented me which prevented me from moving  out of the way."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,I shall do so.
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,One hundred twenty two thousand two hundred
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"Captain, to affect the ship at this extreme range would require  a highly sophisticated planetary defence system."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,Captain. Those co-ordinates are a short distance in that  direction.
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"Captain. In each case, this was unavoidable."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,I don't see how.
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,You are under orders to investigate this planet and this  culture.
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"No one has ever stated that Starfleet duty was particularly  safe. You've followed the correct and logical course, done everything a  commander could do. Self-recriminations  Captain, our friend  is back."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"Mister Chekov, your tricorder readings are totally inefficient!"
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"Ensign, I will not have you address me in that tone of voice!"
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"Captain, this is fascinating. If you will permit me, sir?"
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"Fascinating. A very high order of  workmanship, very ancient, generating great power."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"No, Captain. The centre is deep in the earth beneath us. This is  an access point. It would also seem to be a"
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,Obviously.
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"Yes, quite. It extends some thirty feet beyond the figure in all  directions. Conventional in composition, and quite formidable."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"Yes, indeed it does, Captain. It makes me uncomfortable."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,Yes. Spock. I am Spock.
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,I fail to see what they find so amusing.
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,Quite possible. It checks with my atmospheric analysis. Their  atmosphere completely negates any harmful effects from their sun.
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"Apparently, our hypothesis is correct. There is no living being  there. It is a machine, nothing more."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"Evidently not. This is no ordinary machine, Captain. It may well  possess a rudimentary intelligence."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,That may not be of any help. The Enterprise has only ten hours  left in which to break free.
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,Acknowledged.
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"In my view, a splendid example of reciprocity."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"Doctor, you insist on applying human standards to non-human  cultures. I remind you that humans are only a tiny minority in this  galaxy."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,Another is their right to choose a system which seems to work  for them.
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"Doctor, these people are healthy and they are happy. What ever  you choose to call it, this system works, despite your emotional  reaction to it."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,I see no alternative.
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"Well, I believe it's safe,  safe to assume that they  would receive the necessary instructions."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"I am concerned, Captain. This may not be an  ideal society, but it is a viable one."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"If we do what it seems we must, in my opinion it will be in  direct violation of the non-interference directive."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,Starfleet Command may think otherwise.
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,Captain!
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,Disturbing. The people of Vaal seem to have disappeared.
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"Force field, Captain."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"Variation in impulses, Captain. I believe it is reading us. A  strong jump on all wavelengths."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"Doctor, you have an unsurpassed talent for understatement."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,The good doctor was concerned that the Vaalians achieved true  human stature. I submit there is no cause for worry. They've taken the  first step. They've learned to kill.
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"Readings are getting weaker, Captain. Wide  variation in energy transmissions, as though Vaal were trying to draw  on other sources."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,I would assume so.
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"If it had to reinforce its energy field to ward off a phaser  attack, it would have to draw more heavily on its reserves."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"A tremendous upsurge in generated power, Captain. Obviously Vaal  is trying to reinforce his energy field."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"No power generation at all, Captain. Vaal is dead."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"That's not unusual, Doctor."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"Captain, I'm not at all certain we did the correct thing on  Gamma Trianguli Six."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"Captain, you are aware of the biblical story of Genesis."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"Precisely, Captain, and in a manner of speaking, we have given  the people of Vaal the apple, the knowledge of good and evil if you  will, as a result of which they too have been driven out of paradise."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"Not at all, Captain."
The  Apple ,"13 Oct, 1967  ",38,"I am not aware of anyone who fits that description, Captain."

The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"Our arrival was scheduled well in advance, Doctor. The annual  check of every scientific expedition is routine."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"Quite impossible, Doctor. I ran a personnel check on this  expedition before we beamed down. I assure you that none of them were   (He is interrupted by the entrance of an old man and woman."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,Sensors reveal nothing which is inimical to human life. The  atmosphere screens out the usual amount of harmful cosmic rays.
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"I have already begun investigation into that possibility,  Captain."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"I've rechecked the sensors, Captain. Gamma Hydra Four checks out  as a Class M planet with a conventional oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere and  normal mass. I can find nothing at all out of the ordinary."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,We're checking it on it. I've reached no conclusions as yet. The  comet was a rogue and has never been investigated.
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"Based on what Doctor McCoy  gave me, I estimate that physically we each have less than a week to  live. Also, since our mental faculties are aging faster than our  bodies, we will be little better than mental vegetables in considerably  lesser time."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"Yes, Captain. In a very short time."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"I must differ with you, Doctor. I'm having  difficulty concentrating, which is most disturbing, my eye sight  appears to be failing, and the normal temperature of the ship seems to  me to be increasingly cold."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"Captain, you sent such a message this morning."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"Captain, I believe  Captain.  Captain."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"Yes, sir. Quite understandable."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"Yes, sir. We have the cause of the affliction."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"The orbit of Gamma Hydra Four carried the planet directly  through the comet's trail. On conventional radiation settings, we  discovered nothing. On resetting our sensors to the extreme lower range  of the scale, undetected radiation appeared. Below normal radiation  levels but definitely present, and undoubtedly residue from the comet."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"Quadrant four four eight, sir."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"Mister Sulu, what is our present position?"
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"Possibly, Doctor, because my thinking processes are not as  efficient as before."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"I have a question for the doctor.  Doctor, the  ship's temperature is increasingly uncomfortable for me. I've adjusted  the environment in my quarters to one hundred twenty five degrees,  which is at least tolerable. However, I"
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,I wondered if perhaps there was something which could lower my  sensitivity to cold.
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,Yes. As I always suspected.
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,Commodore?
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,I am aware of that.
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"For what, sir?"
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"On what grounds, Commodore?"
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"Need I remind you, sir, that I too have contracted the same  affliction?"
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"I'm half human, sir. My physical reflexes are down, my mental  capacity is reduced. I tire easily. No, sir. I am not fit for command."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"Sir, I do have duties to perform."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"I resist that suggestion, Commodore."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"Very well, sir. The hearing shall convene at fourteen hundred  hours."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,Let it read that this competency hearing was  ordered by Commodore Stocker and reluctantly called by myself.
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"On the contrary, Commodore. As presiding officer and as second  in command of the Enterprise, the responsibility is mine. Captain Kirk,  would you like to make a statement?"
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"It is quite impossible, Captain. The regulations are quite  specific. You are entitled to direct examination of all witnesses  immediately after the board has questioned them."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"Mister Sulu, how long have you served with Captain Kirk?"
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"To your knowledge, has he ever had any difficulty making  decisions?"
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,Did he order you to maintain standard orbit around Gamma Hydra  Four?
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"Did he not, several minutes later, repeat that order?"
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,Did he order you to increase orbit?
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,Did he not several minutes later repeat that order?
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"Mister Sulu, please answer the question."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"Thank you, Mister Sulu. Yeoman Atkins, you handed Captain Kirk a  fuel consumption report in the presence of witnesses, which he read and  signed. Is that correct?"
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"Yeoman, you will simply answer the question."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,You guess?
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"Thank you, Yeoman. You may leave. Lieutenant Uhura. I have here  a bulletin from Starfleet Command which states that the Romulans have  broken Code two. Are these your initials which appear at the bottom?"
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,And whose initials are those which appear directly below yours?
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,Did Captain Kirk ask you to send a message about the comet which  passed Gamma Hydra Four?
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,Using Code two.
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,After you reminded him that the Romulans had broken Code two.
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"Thank you, Lieutenant. Doctor McCoy, Doctor McCoy!"
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"Several hours ago, at the request of this board, you ran a  complete physical examination of Captain Kirk."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"Medical banks, compute described subject's physical age, using  established norms as comparative base."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,Doctor McCoy.
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,Will you give us your professional evaluation of Captain Kirk's  present physical condition.
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,Is not his mental capacity degenerating even more rapidly?
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"Doctor, you heard the computer's analysis of Captain Kirk's  physical age. Do you agree with it?"
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"Do you agree with it, Doctor?"
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"This board has no further questions. Unless you, Commodore  Stocker, have something that you would like to add."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"Do you wish to call any witnesses, Captain Kirk?"
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"Captain, I would suggest"
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"Gamma Hydra Four, Captain."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"You're inability to remember having given commands, reading and  signing important orders and then forgetting them, your physical  analysis as compiled by our own chief surgeon. All these things would  appear to be irrefutable proof of failing physical and mental  conditions."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"We have no more questions, Captain."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"There'll be no more questions, Captain. If you would leave the  room so the board can vote"
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"Sir, you have never commanded a starship."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,The danger from the Romulans
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"Yes, Captain."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"I'm sorry, Captain."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,Regulations require
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"Captain, I have not assumed command."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"I suffer the same affliction as you, sir."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,Commodore Stocker.
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,Mister Scott was unfit for command. Commodore Stocker is ranking  officer
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"I cannot, Captain."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"No, sir. Only Commodore Stocker can give a command order onboard  this ship."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,It would seem to be the place where I can be of the most use.
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"No, not all the time. Captain, he left us for a few moments."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"Yes. Yes, indeed, Captain. Doctor, you remember"
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"Quite possible, Doctor. Perhaps a sufficiently efficacious  compound could be developed."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"Doctor, I made the necessary computations and produced this  serum. It is crude and dangerous, but we have no time for refinements."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"It could cure or kill, Doctor."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"Doctor Wallace, give him the shot."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"Romulans giving ground, Captain. Obviously, they tapped in as  you expected them to."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"Yes, sir."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"The Romulans were caught off guard, Captain. They're falling  behind."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"I am quite ready now, Doctor."
The  Deadly Years ,"8 Dec, 1967 ",40,"That is very considerate of you, Doctor."
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,Something wrong?

"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,"Specifics, Doctor. Labels do not make arguments."
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,I see.
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,I find your argument strewn with gaping defects in logic.
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,"That's not at all surprising, Doctor. He's probably terrified of  your beads and rattles."
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,Interesting.
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,"Confirmed, Captain. He's taken out all the override controls. If  we tamper without knowing where the trigger relay is,  we could extinguish ourselves."
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,And most sophisticated.
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,"He simply appears to have turned  himself off, Captain. And since we cannot repair the damage he has done  without destroying the ship"
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,Five hundred of the same model? That seems rather redundant.
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,He did not pay royalties.
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,"The guilty party has his choice. Death by electrocution, death  by gas, death by phaser, death by hanging."
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,"You went to substantial risk and effort to bring a starship  here. Logically, you must have a compelling motive."
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,Then I'm unable to discern your problem.
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,Whom do you serve now?
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,"We are, and we must direct our attack to the heart of the  matter. Obviously this many androids cannot operate independently.  There must be a central control system which guides the entire android  population."
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,Very interesting. Very interesting. This is a most unusual  device.
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,Did I understand there are more than two hundred thousand of  you?
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,This would seem to be a simple relay centre. Are all of you  controlled through this device?
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,"Oh, that's quite understandable.       ALICE"
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,"Captain, I've just had a most fascinating  meeting with Norman, and I'm convinced I've discovered a very important  inconsistency."
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,"He could successfully accomplish it, Captain. I've questioned a  number of the androids, and they're totally loyal to Mudd.  Perhaps of more concern is the fact that this android population can  literally provide anything a human being could ask for in unlimited  quantity."

"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,Eminently practical.
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,"Indeed, it is not. They may quite possibly be able to accomplish  it."
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,"Whatever method we use to stop them, we must make haste. They  have only to install some cybernetic devices aboard the Enterprise and  they'll be able to leave orbit."
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,I asked them.
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,Yet the device that Norman claims to be their central control is  totally inadequate to the task of directing more than two hundred  thousand of them.
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,"There are a large number of Alices and Trudies, Maisies,  Annabels, and according to my research, a Herman series, an Oscar  series, a whole plethora of series in fact. But only one Norman."
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,"To function as they do, each android mind must be one component  of a mass brain linked through a central locus."

"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,I fail to understand why I should care to induce my mother to  purchase falsified patents.

"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,"Yes, of course. That is exactly why I hate you. Because you are  identical."
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,Fascinating.
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,"Success, Captain. We've been pruning the leaves and branches of  the tree. Now it is time to get to work on the root."
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,Affirmative.
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,Logic is a little tweeting bird chirping in a meadow. Logic is a  wreath of pretty flowers which smell bad.  Are you sure your circuits are registering correctly? Your ears are  green.
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,"Very well, Captain."
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,"I believe that is the correct amount, Captain. Mister Mudd, are  you ready?"
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,Be careful. I would not want you to drop it.
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,"I believe they are all immobilised, Captain."
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,"That is a human emotion, Doctor, with which I am totally  unfamiliar. How could I be unhappy?"
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,"Which I find eminently satisfactory, Doctor, for nowhere am I so  desperately needed as among a shipload of illogical humans."
"I,  Mudd ","3 Nov, 1967 ",41,The androids are being reprogrammed. Their original purpose was  to adapt this planet for productive use. They'll begin that work again.

The  Trouble With Tribbles ,"29 Dec, 1967 ",42,"Based on computer analysis, of course, taking into account the  possibilities of"
The  Trouble With Tribbles ,"29 Dec, 1967 ",42,"Well, it was Mister Scott who performed the actual engineering."
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,"No doubt about it, Captain. The space debris comes from the  survey vessel SS Beagle."
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,"Portions of the antimatter nacelles, personal belongings.  Captain, no signs of bodies whatsoever."
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,"It would have come from planet four, star system eight nine two,  directly ahead."
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,"SS Beagle. Small class four stardrive vessel. Crew of forty  seven, commanded by. Jim, I believe you knew him. Captain R M Merik."
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,"Different in shape only, Captain. The proportion of land to  water is exactly as on your Earth. Density five point five, diameter  seven nine one seven at the equator, atmosphere seventy eight percent  nitrogen, twenty one percent oxygen. Again, exactly like Earth."
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,I also picked up indications of large cities.
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,"No sign of atomic power as yet, but far enough along for radio  communications, power transportation, an excellent road system."
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,Television was the colloquial term.
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,"Captain, the one described as the barbarian is also listed here.  Flight officer William B. Harrison of the SS Beagle. At least there  were some survivors down there."
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,"But hardly more practical, captain. Close to the city we  located, but not populated. We should not be observed."
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,Fascinating. This atmosphere is remarkably similar to your  twentieth century. Moderately industrialised pollution containing  substantial amounts of carbon monoxide and partially consumed  hydrocarbons.
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,"Yes, I believe that was the term. I had no idea you were that  much of a historian, Doctor."
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,"Then the Prime Directive is in full force, Captain?"
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,"I fail to see the humour in that situation, Doctor."
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,Complete Earth parallel. The language here is English.
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,There would seem to be evidence to that effect.
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,I call them ears.
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,Never. Colloquial twentieth-century English. An amazing  parallel.
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,"Sir, we came here looking for some friends, forty seven of them  who were stranded here some six years ago. They wore clothing similar  to ours. Have you heard of such men?"
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,"Captain, I thought you might find this  interesting."
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,Fascinating.
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,"Captain, a logical question, if I may. Septimus, how many years  ago did Merikus become your first citizen?"
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,"Curious, Captain, the similarity in names. Were you told why  Merik was dropped from the Space Academy?"
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,"Why, Doctor?"
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,"Even more fascinating. Slavery evolving into an institution with  guaranteed medical payments, old-age pensions."
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,"Doctor, if I were able to show emotion, your new infatuation  with that term would begin to annoy me."
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,"Really, Doctor, I had no idea they were trained. Watching you, I  assumed it was trial and error."
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,"Interesting, and given a conservative empire, quite  understandable."
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,"I said I understood it, Doctor. I find the checks and balances  of this civilisation quite illuminating."
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,"They do seem to have escaped the carnage of your first three  world wars, Doctor."
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,"Situations quite familiar to the six million who died in your  first world war, the eleven million who died in your second, the thirty  seven million who died in your third. Shall I go on?"
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,Quite correct.
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,I tell you I'm well able to defeat you.
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,I do not want to injure you.
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,"Need any help, Doctor?"
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,"Such emotions are foreign to me, Doctor. I'm merely testing the  strength of the door."
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,"Doctor, I am seeking a means of escape. Will you please be  brief?"
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,"Yes, that's quite true."
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,"Oh, yes. You humans have that emotional need to express  gratitude. You're welcome, I believe, is the correct response. However,  Doctor, you must remember I am entirely motivated by logic. The loss of  our ship's surgeon, whatever I think of his skill, would mean a  reduction in the efficiency of the Enterprise and therefore"
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,"Really, Doctor?"
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,What did they do to you?
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,I wish we could have examined that belief of his more closely.  It seems illogical for a sun worshiper to develop a philosophy of total  brotherhood. Sun worship is usually a primitive superstition religion.
Bread  And Circuses ,"15 Mar, 1968 ",43,"It will replace their imperial Rome, but it will happen in their  twentieth century."
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,Vulcan honours us with your presence. We come to serve.
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"Captain, Ambassador Sarek and his wife are my parents.   Captain's log, Stardate 3842.3. We have departed  Vulcan for the neutral planetoid code-named Babel. Since it is in our  sector, the Enterprise has been assigned to transport ambassadors of  Federation planets to this vitally important council. The issues of the  council are politically complex, the passengers explosive."
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,Humans smile with so little provocation.
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,The situation between my father and myself has not changed.
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"Yes, Captain?"
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"If you will excuse me, Captain."
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"Not precisely, Doctor. On Vulcan, the teddy bears are alive, and  they have six-inch fangs."
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"Sensors indicate the size of a scout ship, but the configuration  is unfamiliar. Most unusual."
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,Starfleet records no authorised vessel in this quadrant except  ours.
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"Guess, Captain? I shall need more data for my estimate."
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"Vessel changing course, heading toward us at  high warp speed."
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,Interesting. They were travelling at approximately warp ten.
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"Vulcans. On Vulcan, the method is called tal-shaya. It was  considered a merciful form of execution in ancient times."
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"Indeed, Captain? Interesting."
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,Vulcans do not approve of violence.
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"No, Captain. I'm merely saying it would be illogical to kill  without reason."
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"If there were a reason, my father is quite capable of killing.  Logically and efficiently."
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"Mother. If only on circumstantial evidence, he is a logical  suspect."
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"Yes, Captain. I get sensor readings of tri-tritanium from the  alien ship's hull."
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"Yes, it could adversely affect our mission."
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"Worry is a human emotion, Captain. I accept what has happened.  The ship's hull seems to have a high density level  or is cloaked against sensor probes. It is manned, but sensors cannot  make out specifics."
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,I think it unlikely it is one of theirs.
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"Possibly, Captain. But I cannot decode this transmission."
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,It is in no known code. There's no detectable pattern. No  standard references apply.
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"Only negative. It fits none of our computer records, and it is  alien."
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"Doctor, do you propose surgery for the heart defect?"
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,I suggest that a cryogenic open-heart procedure would be the  logical approach.
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"My blood is T-negative, Doctor."
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,It should be possible to filter out the human factors.
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,Indeed. I would estimate the odds
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,Doctor.
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,Rigelian physiology is very similar to Vulcan.
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,But it does look promising.
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"I consider the safety factor low, but acceptable."
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,It has been used successfully on test subjects on Rigel Five.
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"Miss Chapel? I underwent a physical examination last week. Would  you pull those records, please?"
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,It would seem the only answer.
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"Then you automatically condemn Sarek to death. And you, Doctor,  have no logical alternative either. If you do not operate, Sarek will  die. You now have the means to perform the operation. I am volunteering  myself as the blood donor. I'll be at my station until you require me.     . The Andorian pulls a knife  and stabs Kirk before getting kicked unconscious.)"
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,Spock here.
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,I'll be in the brig questioning the Andorian prisoner.
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"No, Doctor."
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"My first responsibility is to the ship. Our passengers' safety  is by Starfleet order of first importance. We are being followed by an  alien, possibly hostile, vessel. I cannot relinquish command under  these circumstances."
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"On what grounds, Doctor? Command requirements do not recognise  personal privilege. I'll be in the brig interrogating the Andorian."
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,He has been subjected to questioning under verifier scan and  truth drug. He reveals nothing. I suggest his mind has been so  conditioned as part of a preconceived plan.
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,Apparently Thelev did.
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,I do not know. There is no logic in Thelev's attack upon the  captain. There is no logic in Gav's murder.
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,Come in.
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"Mother, when I was commissioned, I took an oath to carry out  responsibilities which were clearly and exactly specified."
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,Any competent officer can command this ship under normal  circumstances. The circumstances are not normal. We're carrying over  one hundred valuable Federation passengers. We're being pursued by an  alien ship. We're subject to possible attack. There has been murder and  attempted murder on board. I cannot dismiss my duties.
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"I know, but this must take precedence. If I could give the  transfusion without loss of time or efficiency, I would.  Sarek understands my reason."
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"Mother, how can you have lived on Vulcan so long, married a  Vulcan, raised a son on Vulcan, without understanding what it means to  be a Vulcan?"
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"It means to adopt a philosophy, a way of life, which is logical  and beneficial. We cannot disregard that philosophy merely for personal  gain, no matter how important that gain might be."
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"Can you imagine what my father would say if I were to agree, if  I were to give up command of this vessel, jeopardise hundreds of lives,  risk interplanetary war, all for the life of one person?"
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,Mother
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,I cannot.
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,Captain?
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"Captain, are you quite all right?"
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,I must see the captain.
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"The alien ship. I've just realised that if their power  utilisation curve is not the norm, it should be possible to identify  them this way. Very important."
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"Captain, I believe you'll find the alien"
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"I think you'll find he's an Orion, Doctor."
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,Intelligence reports that Orion smugglers have been raiding the  Coridan system.
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"The thing that confused me was the power utilisation curve. It  made them seem more powerful than a starship or anything known to us.  That ship was constructed for a suicide mission. Since they never  intended to return to their home base, they could use one hundred  percent power on their attacks. The thing I don't understand is why I  didn't think of it earlier."
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,That hardly seems likely.
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"Emotional, isn't she?"
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,Indeed? Why did you marry her?
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"Doctor, I'll return to my station now."
Journey  to Babel ,"17 Nov, 1967 ",44,"Indeed, Captain. I've never seen him look so happy."
A  Private Little War ,"2 Feb, 1968  ",45,Large prints. The ape-like carnivore in the reports?
A  Private Little War ,"2 Feb, 1968  ",45,"Aside from that, you say it's a Garden of Eden?"
A  Private Little War ,"2 Feb, 1968  ",45,Class M in all respects. Quite Earth-like.
A  Private Little War ,"2 Feb, 1968  ",45,"Bows and arrows, Captain?"
A  Private Little War ,"2 Feb, 1968  ",45,"Captain, look."
A  Private Little War ,"2 Feb, 1968  ",45,"Captain, use of our phasers is expressly forbidden."
A  Private Little War ,"2 Feb, 1968  ",45,"No, Captain. I can travel."
A  Private Little War ,"2 Feb, 1968  ",45,Nurse.
A  Private Little War ,"2 Feb, 1968  ",45,Hit me. The pain will help me to consciousness. Hit me.
A  Private Little War ,"2 Feb, 1968  ",45,"Blast you, strike me! If I don't regain consciousness soon, it  may be too late. Hit me.  Harder!"
A  Private Little War ,"2 Feb, 1968  ",45,Again. Continue. The pain will help me to consciousness.
A  Private Little War ,"2 Feb, 1968  ",45,"That will be quite enough. Thank you, doctor.   M'BENGA: Please, release her."
A  Private Little War ,"2 Feb, 1968  ",45,"She was doing as I requested, Mister Scott. A Vulcan form of  self-healing.   M'BENGA: As you saw, they must wait until the last possible moment then  fight their way back to consciousness."
A  Private Little War ,"2 Feb, 1968  ",45,"Thank you, nurse. I'm quite fully recovered."
A  Private Little War ,"2 Feb, 1968  ",45,"Position, Mister Scott?"
A  Private Little War ,"2 Feb, 1968  ",45,The Klingons?
A  Private Little War ,"2 Feb, 1968  ",45,Stand by to signal the captain.
A  Private Little War ,"2 Feb, 1968  ",45,"An illogical question, Doctor, since  obviously you are hearing my voice."
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,"Acknowledged, Captain."
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,Spock here.
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,"I presume you mean they vanished in a manner  not consistent with the usual workings of the transporter, Mister  Scott."
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,Have you reversed controls?
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,Power surge?
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,"Recheck your equipment, Mister Scott. I'll  scan for them on the planet's surface. Spock out."
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,"I'm beginning to believe that, Mister Scott. I've conducted two  sweeps of the planet's surface. There is no sign of life."
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,"No, Doctor. Even that would show up on our sensors."
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,"The only answers are negative. No magnetic storms, no ionic  interference, no breakdown in your equipment."
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,"We shall continue sensor scans, Doctor. At the moment, that is  all we can do, except hope for a rational explanation."
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,"True, Doctor. Constant exposure does result in a certain degree  of contamination."
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,They are not within the confines of this  solar system.
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,"I have never heard of a study being done, but it would be a  fascinating project."
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,Precisely.
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,No. I would say approximately four hundred
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,"I would welcome a suggestion, Doctor, even an emotional one, as  to where to look."
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,"Captain's log, stardate 3259.2. First  Officer Spock in command. The Captain, Lieutenant Uhura, and Ensign  Chekov have been missing for nearly two hours. Computer probability  projections are useless due to insufficient data."
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,Interesting. It seems to be an ionisation trail.
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,"Exactly the question I have just fed to the computers, Doctor.  And the answer is, nothing known to us would account for it."
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,"Plot a follow course, Ensign Haines."
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,"Doctor, I am chasing the Captain, Lieutenant Uhura, and Ensign  Chekov, not some wild aquatic fowl. This is the only lead we've had."
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,Initiate. Warp factor two.
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,"Projecting back along the path of ionisation, the nearest system  is M two four alpha."
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,Eleven point six three zero.
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,"I'm suggesting nothing, Doctor. I am merely pursuing the only  logical course available to us."
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,We searched the area.
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,Such as a failure in the transporter mechanism?
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,There was no sign of them in the area of Gamma Two.
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,"In that case, Doctor, we have nothing to lose by pursuing our  present course."
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,"Mister Scott, can we manage anything faster  than warp six?"
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,"Doctor, I do not respond to hunches. No transporter malfunction  was responsible for the disappearance. They were not within the Gamma  system. A focused beam of extremely high-intensity light was directed  into the Gamma system from the trinary system we are now approaching.  No known natural phenomena could have caused that beam. Does that  clarify the situation?"
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,"I see.  Gentlemen, I am in command of this vessel, and we  shall continue on our present course.  Unless  it is your intention to declare a mutiny."
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,"Agreed. Mister Scott, could you manage warp seven?"
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,"Ensign, warp seven."
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,"Sensors indicate only one concentration of life forms on the  planet, on the lower hemisphere. Humanoid readings."
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,"There will be no landing force, Doctor. Assuming the captain and  the others are still alive, it would be unwise to endanger them by  beaming down a large contingent."
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,Interesting. No power source. It may be shielded.
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,"I shall beam down, Doctor. If I am unable to communicate, a  landing party may be necessary."
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,"Daniel, as I recall, had only his faith. But I welcome your  company, Doctor. Mister Scott, you'll be in command."
The  Gamesters Of Triskelion ,"5 Jan, 1968 ",46,Fascinating.
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"Our scanner survey was correct, Captain. There it is. Pure  tritanium."
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"Twenty one point four times as hard, to be exact."
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"We won't be able to break it, Captain. I'll phaser off a  specimen."
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,We're in the growing season in this hemisphere of this planet.  There are doubtless many pollen aromas.
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"Captain, dikironium exists only in laboratory experiments."
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"Rizzo's alive, barely."
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"You think you know what it was, Captain?"
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,Continuing scanning. Still no readings of life forms on the  planet.
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"You mentioned dikironium, Captain."
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"I've scanned for that element, Captain. There's no trace of  dikironium on the planet surface or in the atmosphere."
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"To hide from a sensor scan, it would have to be able to change  its molecular structure, like gold changing itself to lead or wood  changing itself to ivory."
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"Chekov, take over on scanner."
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"What was the size of the thing you saw, Ensign?"
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,Composition?
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"Captain, scientifically"
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"I hope I'm not disturbing you, Doctor."
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,I need your advice.
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,I do not understand your reasoning.
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"I do not joke, Doctor. Perhaps I should rephrase my statement. I  require an opinion. There are many aspects of human irrationality I do  not yet comprehend. obsession, for one. The persistent, single-minded  fixation on one idea."
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,Precisely. Have you studied the incident involving the USS  Farragut?
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"Fortunately, I read somewhat faster. In brief, Doctor, nearly  half the crew and the captain were annihilated. The captain's name was  Garrovick."
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"His father. Among the survivors was a young officer on his first  deep-space assignment, James T. Kirk. And there is still more. I  suggest you study this."
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"Correctly phrased, Captain. As recommended in the manual. Our  reply, also as recommended, is, sir, we have noted in your recent  behaviour certain items, which, on the surface, seem unusual. We  respectfully ask permission to inquire further"
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"Sir, the USS Yorktown is waiting now at the rendezvous point. It  carries perishable drugs"
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"Creature, Captain?"
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"You say you could sense its intelligence, Captain? How did it  communicate with you?"
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"Obviously, Captain, if it is an intelligent creature, if it is  the same one, if it therefore is capable of space travel,  it could pose a great threat to inhabited planets."
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"We are barely closing in on it, Captain. We could be pursuing it  for days."
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"Conflicting data, Captain. It seems to be in a borderline state  between matter and energy. Elements of both. It could possibly use  gravitational fields for propulsion."
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"Extremely efficient, Captain. Whether that indicates  intelligence is another matter."
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"The deflectors will not stop it, Captain."
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"I should have surmised this. For the creature to be able to use  gravity as a propulsive force, it would have to have this capacity."
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,May I suggest that we no longer belabour the question of whether  or not we should have gone after the creature. The matter has now been  rendered academic. The creature is now after us.
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"It turned and attacked, Doctor. Its method was well-considered  and intelligent."
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"Impossible to tell, Captain, until I can make a closer survey of  the creature."
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"Captain, the creature's ability to throw itself out of time sync  makes it possible for it to be elsewhere in the instant the phaser  hits. There is therefore no basis for your self-recrimination. If you  had fired on time and on target eleven years ago,  it would have made no more difference than it did an hour ago. Captain  Garrovick would still be dead. The fault was not yours, Jim. In fact,  there was no fault."
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"Ensign, am I correct in my assumption that you've been disturbed  by what you consider to be a failure on your part?  I would like  you to consider that the hesitation for which you are blaming yourself  is an hereditary trait of your species.  When suddenly faced by the unknown or imminent danger, the human will  experience a split second of indecision. He hesitates.  Do I have your attention, Ensign?"
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,I know you would prefer to wallow in emotion rather than
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"Kindness, Mr. Garrovick, is another human emotion, and I believe  we have enough of that. I simply would like you to accept the fact that  your reaction has its basis in physio.  Do  you smell something?"
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,Get out of here! I'll attempt to seal it off.
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"Fortunately, neither of us is dead, Ensign. The reverse pressure  worked. The vent is closed."
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"My haemoglobin is based on copper, not iron."
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"Colloquially expressed, but essentially correct."
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,Do you believe you're in communication with the creature?
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"It was bearing one two seven mark nine, but I've lost it now."
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"It has changed course before to mislead us, Captain. Logic would  dictate that"
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"I do not understand, Captain."
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"And you know where home is, Captain?"
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,Precisely.
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"Doctor, evidence indicates the creature is here to spawn. If so,  it will reproduce by fission, not just into two parts, but thousands."
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,An ounce should be sufficient. We can drain it from the ship's  engines and transport it to the planet surface in a magnetic vacuum  field.
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"There is still one problem, Captain."
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,Exactly. A matter-antimatter blast will rip away half the  planet's atmosphere. If our vessel is in orbit and encounters those  shock waves
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"Also, we cannot be certain the transporter will operate under  those conditions. If a man is beaming up when that hits, we may lose  him."
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"Captain, there is so little hemoglobin in my green blood, the  creature could not harm me extensively. It therefore seems logical for  me to be the one"
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,It will require two men to transport the antimatter unit.
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"Spock here, Captain. Holding at thirty  thousand kilometres."
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,Reset. Energise.
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"We are, Doctor. Cross-circuiting to A."
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,Cross-circuiting to B.
Obsession ,"15 Dec, 1967 ",47,"Mister Scott, there was no deity involved. It was my  cross-circuiting to B that recovered them."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,Interesting. No indications of magnetic storms in this sector.
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"Captain, the Intrepid. It just died. And the four hundred  Vulcans aboard, all dead."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"Doctor, I know what I know."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,Captain.
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"Yes, sir."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"I assure you, Doctor, I am quite all right. The pain was  momentary. It passed quickly."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,I sensed it die.
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"Doctor, even I, a half-Vulcan, could hear the death scream of  four hundred Vulcan minds crying out over the distance between us."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"Call it a deep understanding of the way things happen to  Vulcans, but I know not a person, not even the computers on board the  Intrepid, knew what was killing them or would have understood it had  they known."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"I've noticed that about your people, Doctor. You find it easier  to understand the death of one than the death of a million. You speak  about the objective hardness of the Vulcan heart, yet how little room  there seems to be in yours."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,It might have rendered your history a bit less bloody.
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,Indications of energy turbulence ahead. Unable to analyse. I've  never encountered readings like this before.
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,I would assume that.
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"Not very likely, Ensign."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"Still not able to analyse, Captain. Sensors are feeding data to  the computers now. Whatever this dark zone is, it lies directly in line  with the course I calculate for the Intrepid and the Gamma Seven-A  system."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"I have none, Captain. Insufficient data."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,Lieutenant.
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,No analysis due to insufficient information.
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"I am well aware of that, Captain, but the computers contain  nothing on this phenomenon. It is beyond our experience, and the new  information is not yet significant."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"It is not liquid, gaseous, or solid, despite the fact we cannot  see through it."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"It is not a galactic nebula such as the Coal Sack, and since our  deflectors were activated by it, it would seem to be some form of  energy, but nothing our sensors can identify."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,Very possible.
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,Captain?
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"Analysing now, Captain."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"Negative, Captain. All systems functioning properly."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"Unknown, Captain."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"That sound was turbulence caused by the penetration of a  boundary layer, Captain."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,Unknown.
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,Between where we were and where we are.
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"It would never occur to me, Captain."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"We still have no specifics, but we seem to have entered a zone  of energy which is incompatible with our living and mechanical  processes. As we draw closer to the source, it grows stronger and we  grow weaker."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"Sir, we are accelerating. We are being  pulled toward the centre of the zone of darkness."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"Unknown, Captain. I suggest you order Mister Scott to give us  reverse power."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"In that case, Captain, I would suggest we  apply forward thrust."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"It's logical to assume that something within this zone absorbs  all forms of energy whether mechanically or biologically produced.  Whatever it is, it would seem to be the same thing which drew all the  energy out of an entire solar system  and the Intrepid."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"I would say not, Captain. The analysis of the zone indicates it  is a negative energy field, however illogical that may sound, but it is  not the source of the power drain."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"I submit, Mister Scott, if we do not get out, the shields would  be extraneous. It would only prolong our wait for death by a short  period of time."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"Captain, the Intrepid would have done all these things too, and  yet they were destroyed."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,True. It is also true they never knew what was killing them.  Their logic would not have permitted them to believe they were being  killed.
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,Vulcan has not been conquered within its collective memory. The  memory goes back so far that no Vulcan can conceive of a conqueror. I  knew the ship was lost because I sensed it.
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,The touch of death.
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,Astonishment.
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"I cannot say what it is, Captain, but I would say it has found  us."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"Getting very confused readings, Captain, but this is definitely  the source of the energy drain."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,Probe will impact in seven point three seconds.
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"Readings coming in now, Captain. Length, approximately eleven  thousand miles. Width varying from two thousand to three thousand  miles. Outer layer studded with space debris and waste. Interior  consists of protoplasm, varying from a firmer gelatinous layer to a  semi-fluid central mass. Condition, living."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"That is what is drawing us toward it, Captain. The same way it  drew the Intrepid to her death."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"Energy itself, perhaps, drained from us. I would speculate that  this unknown life form is invading our galaxy like a virus."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"The Intrepid must have come across the organism while it was  still low in energy, still hungry. We are not safe, Captain. We merely  have a little more time than the Intrepid did."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"I must differ with you, Captain. We have sent unmanned probes  into it. They have given us some information but they have not told us  what we need to know, and we cannot afford the power to take blind  shots at it, hoping to kill it."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,The thing evidently has reflexes. The unmanned probe we sent in  must have stung it when it entered. The lurch we felt was the  turbulence of its reaction.
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"You have a martyr complex, Doctor. I submit that it disqualifies  you."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,The Vulcans saw it first and died.
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,I am more capable.
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"Which makes you indispensable, Captain. Further, you are not a  science specialist."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"We don't have one day, Doctor. We have precisely one hour and  thirty five minutes of power left."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"Captain, I"
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"Do not suffer so, Doctor. This is not the  first time superior capability has proven more valuable than  professional credentials."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"I am familiar with the equipment, Doctor. We're wasting time.  The shuttlecraft is ready."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"This is not a competition, Doctor. Whether you understand it or  not, grant me my own kind of dignity."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,Then employ one of your own superstitions. Wish me luck.
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,Power drain is enormous and growing worse.
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,We discussed that possibility earlier. But  you will need this information.
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,Slowing now. Contact in eighteen point three seconds. Brace  yourselves. The area of penetration will no doubt be sensitive. Contact
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"There was nothing to spare. I shall continue  my tests. Oh, and Doctor McCoy. You would have not survived it."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"I am moving slowly now, establishing course  toward what appears to be the nucleus."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,Calculations indicate the shields will last only forty seven  minutes.
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,Changes indicate the organism has stored  sufficient energy for reproductive process to commence.
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,I am slowly losing life support and minimal  shield energies. According to my calculations
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"Personal log, Commander Spock, USS  Enterprise. I have noted the passage of the Enterprise on its way to  whatever awaits it.  If this record should survive me, I wish it known that I bequeath my  highest commendation and testimonial to the captain,  officers, and crew of the Enterprise. The finest starship in the fleet."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,Do not risk the ship further on my behalf.
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"Why, thank you, Captain McCoy."
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,Shuttlecraft to Enterprise. Shuttlecraft to  Enterprise. Request permission to come aboard.
The  Immunity Syndrome ,"19 Jan, 1968 ",48,"Obviously, Captain. And I have some  fascinating data on the organism."
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,It will be interesting to see the results of the contamination.
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,Horizon reports indicate the Iotians are  extremely intelligent and somewhat imitative.
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"The damage has been done, Doctor. We are here to repair it."
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,Fascinating.
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"Interesting, Captain. Passers-by are carrying, I believe,  firearms."
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"Sir, would you mind explaining that statement, please?"
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"Sir, does everyone here carry firearms?"
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"Sir, there are several questions I would like to ask."
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"Does that include, if I may ask, a gentleman called Krako?"
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,Captain? Gangsters. Chicago. Mobs. Published in 1992. Where'd  you get this?
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"This is the contamination, Captain. Astonishing. An entire  culture based on this."
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"Fascinating, but quite impossible."
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,They evidently seized upon that one book as the blueprint for an  entire society.
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"We may quarrel with Mister Oxmyx' methods, but his goal is  essentially the correct one. This society must become united or it will  degenerate into total anarchy."
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"Unfortunately, I do not have access to my computers, nor are  these gentlemen likely to permit it."
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,I'm familiar with the culture on Beta Antares. There aren't  games
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"I have never computed them, Captain."
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"Surely, you're coming, Captain."
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"Very simple. Amplitude modulation transmission. I simply adjust  the frequency, throw this switch, and the Enterprise should answer."
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,Fascinating.
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"Let me see.  Enterprise, this is Mister Spock."
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"A very long and complicated story,  Lieutenant. Notify the transporter room, Two to beam up, these  co-ordinates."
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"Futile, Doctor. No specifics. There is no record of such a  culture based on a moral inversion."
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"No, Doctor. I'm merely saying the computers can offer us no  logical, rational, factual way out of our current dilemma."
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"On audio, Lieutenant. Mister Oxmyx, this is Mister Spock."
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"Irrelevant, since we are here."
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,Why would he put a bag on our captain?
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"If I understand you correctly, that would seem to be a problem."
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"I'm afraid I find it difficult to trust you, Mister Oxmyx."
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,You'll show no further hostility?
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"Since we must have our captain back, I  accept."
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"If we are to save the captain without blatant, forceful  interference on this planet, Doctor, we must have the assistance of  someone indigenous. We are therefore forced to trust Mister Oxmyx."
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"Mister Scott, though we hope to avoid  interference, I suggest you set one of our phaser banks on a strong  stun position."
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"I trust we shall not have to use them, but it is best to be  prepared. Energise."
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"Mister Oxmyx, I understood we had an arrangement, a truce."
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"Sir, you are employing a double negative."
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,I fail to see why you do not understand us. You yourself have  stated the need for unity of authority on this planet. We agree.
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"Co-operation, sir, would inevitably result"
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"We did, Captain. The situation required our return."
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,Nothing useful. Logic and practical information do not seem to  apply here.
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"To deny the facts would be illogical, Doctor."
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"I'm not sanguine about hunches, Captain, but I have no practical  alternative."
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"A fliwer, Captain."
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,Interesting.
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"Yes. Oh. I believe they had a device known as a clutch. Clutch,  Captain. Perhaps one of those pedals on the floor."
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"Captain, you are an excellent starship commander, but as a taxi  driver you leave much to be desired."
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"If we can get close enough to them, we should be able to render  them harmless with reasonable rapidity."
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,I beg your pardon?
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,Young man
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"Young man, this is likely to be quite hazardous."
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,You do not even know what the action is going to be.
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,Logical.
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"Captain, I believe that perhaps it would be wise to do as he  says. I just heard the sound of"
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,Unquestionably.
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,Right.
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,A miniscule. A very small piece.
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,Right.
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,Check.
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,Must we?
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,But not as safe.
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"Not at all, Captain. It's your driving that alarms me."
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"I would advise you to keep dialing, Oxmyx."
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"Brooding, Captain?"
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"Captain, I'm neither brooding nor sombre. But I do have  reservations about your solution to the problem of the Iotians."
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"Highly irregular, to say the least, Captain. I'm also curious as  to how you propose to explain to Starfleet Command  that a starship will be sent each year to collect our cut."
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,"Captain. If the Iotians, who are very bright and imitative  people, should take that communicator apart"
A  Piece Of The Action ,"12 Jan, 1968 ",49,The transtator is the basis for every important piece of  equipment that we have.
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,"No life form readings, Captain. Continuing scan."
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,"I am getting readings on small metallic objects, Captain. It is  possible the ship was destroyed in space and the survivors proceeded  here in a shuttle craft."
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,Confirmed.
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,Interesting. A neural field?
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,What brings you here?
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,Why use our vessel? Why not transmit a message to your galaxy?
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,"Fascinating material. Similar to diburnium, but considerably  more dense. I doubt even phaser fire could disturb its molecular  structure."
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,"No, Doctor. More than that. They registered as perfect human  life forms. I recall noting the readings were almost classic textbook  responses. Most curious."
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,The chances are very much against it.
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,"Gentlemen, I'm constrained to point out we do not even know what  this projector looks like."
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,Possible. I would have to have one to examine.
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,"Yes, I recall, Captain. I led him to believe we had escaped."
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,I shall attempt it.
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,"Yes, I will be all right, Captain. We must hurry."
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,"Yes, quite all right, Doctor."
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,"I did not break it, Doctor. I was thrown away by something I've  never experienced before."
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,"A series of bizarre and exotic images bursting on my mind and  consciousness. Colours, shapes, mathematical equations fused and  blurred. I've been attempting to isolate them, but so far I've been  able to recall clearly only one. Immense beings, a hundred limbs which  resemble tentacles. Minds of such control and capacity that each limb  is capable of performing a different function."
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,Undoubtedly.
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,"I'm dubious of the possibilities of success, Captain. The  medical equipment is not designed to put out a great deal of power. The  polarized elements would burn out quickly."
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,A small one.
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,"I assure you, Captain, I am in perfect health."
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,We find it more restful to the body than your so-called  vacation.
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,It will take me a moment to prepare.
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,"I've located their power source, captain. It's installed in  Engineering."
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,"Whatever it is we must do, it is impossible."
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,This material surrounding the projector is the same as I  discovered on the planet. Readings indicate it is impervious to any of  our weapons. We cannot penetrate the casing to get to the machine.
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,"There is one other possibility, Mister Scott. The final  decision, of course, must be the captain's, but  I believe we must have it ready for him. The Enterprise is propelled by  matter-anti-matter reactors. The barrier we must traverse is negative  energy."
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,Nor I. But it must be made available to the captain.
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,"Impossible, Captain. The power source is protected by a material  we cannot breach even with our phasers. Mister Scott and I have  prepared the means for the only logical alternative available to us."
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,The barrier we must penetrate is composed of negative energy.
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,"When we engage the barrier, the ship will explode. The Kelvans  will be stopped here."
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,"Sensors indicate density negative, radiation negative, energy  negative.  All  instruments off the dials, Captain. We are in contact with the  barrier."
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,"Instruments returning to normal, Captain."
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,Life support systems sustaining on emergency.
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,"I have reviewed ship's personnel, Captain. It appears we four  are the only ones the Kelvans consider essential."
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,Captain?
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,Most curious.
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,"The isolated glimpses of things I saw when I touched Kelinda's  mind are beginning to coalesce in my consciousness. The Kelvans have  superior intellectual capacity. To achieve it, they have apparently  sacrificed anything which would tend to distract them. Perceptive  senses such as taste, touch, smell, and, of course, emotions."
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,"Yes. Quite correct, Captain. But they have taken human form and  are therefore having human reaction."
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,That seems reasonable.
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,"Yes. Humans are very peculiar. I often find them unfathomable,  but an interesting psychological study."
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,I believe you're referring to a kiss. But it is my understanding  that such apologies are usually exchanged between people who have some  affection for each other.
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,Your game is off. Are you disturbed by the incident?
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,"You've known Kelinda for some time. She's a Kelvan as you are.  Among humans, I've found the symptoms you're displaying usually  indicate jealousy."
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,Captain Kirk seems to find her quite attractive.
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,You are not jealous?
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,Nor upset?
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,Checkmate.
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,Rojan has exhibited symptoms of jealousy.
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,"Doctor, I'm due for another injection of stokaline."
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,Stokaline.
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,Automatic sensors and various other recording devices require  monitoring and periodic adjustments.
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,"If you wish, I shall call him to the bridge."
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,I left him in the recreation room.
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,"No, Kelinda was with him. She seemed anxious to speak to him."
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,"It would appear, sir, that you have little control over her. Or  perhaps Captain Kirk has more."
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,"Rojan, you are only a link in a chain, following an order given  three hundred years ago. This is an opportunity for you to establish a  destiny of your own."
By  Any Other Name ,"23 Feb, 1968 ",50,A robot ship could be sent to Kelva with the Federation  proposal.
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,Someone or something is attempting to attract our attention.
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"I do not know. Not even a Vulcan can know the unknown, Captain.  We are hundreds of light years past where any Earth ship has ever  explored."
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"Class M planet, Captain."
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"With two very important exceptions. It's much older than Earth,  and about a half million years ago, its atmosphere was totally ripped  away by some sort of cataclysm. The planet has evidently been dead  since then. Sensors detect no life of any kind."
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,Captain.
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,Sensors registering some form of energy deep inside the planet.
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"Reading energy only, Captain. No life forms."
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"Coming from deep under the planet's surface, Captain. Under at  least one hundred miles of solid rock."
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"Reading a chamber now. Oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere, suitable for  human life support."
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"Captain, I do wish to inspect whatever this is that lived that  long ago."
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,Fascinating.
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"Evidently, Captain."
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,Unlikely. These co-ordinates correspond with the location of the  subterranean chamber.
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"I'm sure she did, Captain, Just as you received an order to  bring me along."
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"Approximately one hundred twelve point three seven miles,  Doctor."
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"Captain, the security guards."
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"This vault was constructed about a half a million years ago.  About the same time the planet surface was destroyed, if our sensor  readings are accurate."
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,They're an alloy or substance completely unknown to me. Much  stronger and harder than anything I've measured before.
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"Sargon, would it harm you if I"
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,Pure energy. Matter without form.
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"That would tend, however, to explain certain elements of Vulcan  prehistory."
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"Just a moment, Doctor."
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"And if he refuses, Doctor, what do you propose to do with your  phaser? That is still Jim's body."
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,What are your plans for it? Can you exchange places again when  you wish?
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,Doctor?
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,What is it you want of us?
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,When the struggle came which devastated your planet
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,Fascinating.
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"These others, they were stored differently than you, but it was  your task to remain in the receptacle out there"
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"Our bodies, Sargon, for what purpose?"
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"Then you intend to construct mechanical bodies, move your minds  into them, and then return our bodies to us."
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"Captain, do you know what happened? Do you remember any part of  it?"
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"Once inside their mechanical bodies, engineer, they can leave  this planet, travel back with us. With their knowledge, mankind could  leap ahead ten thousand years."
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"No, he's not."
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"Hello. Oh, you are a lovely  female. A pleasant sight to wake up to after half a million years."
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,You're welcome.
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"This is an excellent body, Doctor. I seem to have received the  best of the three. Strength, hearing, eyesight, all far above your  human norms. I'm surprised the Vulcans never conquered your race."
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"Yes, of course, Just as we do, Doctor."
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"It will be unnecessary, Doctor. This Vulcan body is accustomed  to the higher metabolism."
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"I'll prepare the formula, Sargon."
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,I can continue in this body for several hours.
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,This woman will assist me.  You will take me to your  pharmacology laboratory.
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"Now. this formula will reduce the heart  action and the bodily functions to normal. While the bodies are  occupied, you will administer one injection of ten cc's each hour."
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,This hypo you will code mark for Thalassa. And this one you will  code mark for me.
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,This one you will administer to Captain Kirk while Sargon is in  his body.
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"No, that's correct. But since I will arrange for you to  administer each of the injections, no one else will notice."
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,What were you saying?
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"Yes. Well, you were about to say that you watched me prepare the  formula and fill each of the hypos."
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"Very good. You see, Sargon would not permit me to keep this  body. It is therefore necessary for you to kill your captain  so that Sargon will die with him.   Enterprise Medical Log. Stardate 4769.1. Three  alien minds now inhabit the bodies of Captain Kirk, Science Officer  Spock, and Doctor Ann Mulhall."
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"In two days, you'll have your own hands, Thalassa. Mechanically  efficient and quite human-looking. Android robot hands, of course.  Hands without feeling. Enjoy the taste of life while you can."
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"It will have twice the strength and agility of your body,  engineer, and will last a thousand years. That is, assuming you'll stop  wasting your time and allow us to complete it."
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"A thousand-year prison, Thalassa. And when it wears out we'll  build another one, and we'll lock ourselves into it for another  thousand years. And another, and another. Sargon has closed his mind to  a better way. With these bodies."
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"When you awoke in this body, Thalassa, you said how good it was  to breathe again, to have eyes and to see again. To feel. To live and  feel again, Thalassa. Just think how much we can do for mankind. Are  these bodies too much to ask for in return? Would you prefer this?"
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"This is your new home, Thalassa. Once occupied, I'll add female  features and some texturing. You no doubt want the mechanism to at  least appear to be a woman.  It is ready,  Thalassa."
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,You have no excuse to keep the real body any longer. Sargon  would've required that you enter the mechanism immediately.
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"Must I make an example of you, too, Helm?"
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"Pain, Captain. And you, my dear?"
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"Fortunately, Doctor, I know every thought of every mind around  me. See?  Take the hypo from him. And inject him with it."
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"Fools. I'll simply transfer to another place, another body."
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"Sargon! No, Sargon, please. Let me. Let me transfer."
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"It seems, Doctor, the injection was only enough to cause  unconsciousness."
Return  To Tomorrow ,"9 Feb, 1968 ",51,"The place Henoch would least suspect, Captain."
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,"Passing outer planet, Zeon."
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,"I never met John Gill, but I studied Earth history from the text  he prepared."
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,What impressed me most was his treatment of Earth history as  causes and motivations rather than dates and events.
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,"Yes, but it must be a Zeon ship. Zeons do have a crude  interplanetary capability. Reaction powered. A small rocket. It is on  an intercept course. That would mean it has sophisticated detection  devices which neither Zeon nor Ekos should have."
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,"Captain, it's an unmanned probe which seems to be carrying a  warhead."
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,Fascinating. A thermonuclear warhead.
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,Most interesting. We were attacked by a thermonuclear missile  from a planet which should have no such weapon.
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,"According to our records, the Ekosians are a primitive, warlike  people in a state of anarchy. The other planet, Zeon, has a relatively  high technology, and its people are peaceful."
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,"Ready, Captain."
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,"The Ekosians are humanoid, so there is apt to be a similarity in  architecture. Interesting."

Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,Fascinating.
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,"You propose we pass ourselves off as Nazis, Captain?"
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,"That's very well taken, Captain."
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,Yes. Obviously he's not one of us. I captured him. Is that not  correct procedure with enemies of the Fatherland?
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,Take charge of him.
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,"Your uniform, Captain."
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,Quite correct. You should make a very convincing Nazi.
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,"Yes. I shall tend to it, Major."
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,Obviously.
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,Why do the Nazis hate Zeons?
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,Is Zeon a threat to them?
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,It would seem the assumption was premature.
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,That would coincide with the time of John Gill's arrival.
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,"Captain, the flaw in the plan is this locked door, and the guard  beyond it. To the logical mind, the outlook is somewhat gloomy."
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,Yes.
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,Of course. The rubindium crystals in the transponders.
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,"Yes. We must hold the crystals rigidly at a specific distance,  which I believe should be twenty seven point two millimetres."
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,"Twenty seven point two millimetres would be, approximately,  there. That is, of course, a crude estimation."
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,"Yes. To reach that light, I shall require some sort of platform."
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,"Now, the rubindium crystals should find enough power here to  achieve the necessary stimulus. As I recall from the history of  physics, the ancient lasers were able to achieve the necessary  excitation, even using crude natural crystals."
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,"Yes, of course, Captain. You realise that the aim will of course  be very crude."
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,"Captain, why should I aim at such a structure?"
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,"May I remind you, we did not intend to fight."
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,Possibly.
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,I do not see them.
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,"Captain, without phasers, and until we are able to communicate  with the ship, it is illogical to assume that we can hold out against  the entire military force of this planet."
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,"Captain, I suggest the most profitable use of our time would be  to reassemble our communicators. May I work undisturbed somewhere?"
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,"By using parts from both, I've completed one communicator. I do  not know if the circuits are correct, Captain. There is no way to test  it, except in actual use."

Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,"This young lady is a Nazi, a hero of the Fatherland. We saw her  being decorated."
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,That is correct.
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,"As an honoured member of the Party, she could get us past the  guards."
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,"Captain, I'm beginning to understand why you  Earthmen enjoy gambling. No matter how carefully one computes the odds  of success, there is still a certain exhilaration in the risk."
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,I hope not.
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,"Captain, it was John Gill, but he never moved. Never once looked  up."
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,Or a deep psychosis.

Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,Yes. A doctor should have more pride.
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,"Captain, I do not understand how he failed to recognise us."
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,True. I shall reconsider.
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,"Captain, the speech follows no logical pattern."
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,What drug?
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,"Captain. I have created a condition in which Gill cannot  initiate speech or any other action, but he can reply to questions."
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,"Quite correct. For the last few years, the real power has been  Melakon."
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,"Quite true, Captain. That tiny country, beaten, bankrupt,  defeated, rose in a few years to stand only one step away from global  domination."
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,"Perhaps Gill felt that such a state, run benignly, could  accomplish its efficiency without sadism."
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,"Is he dead, Captain?"
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,"Indeed, Captain. With the union of two cultures, this system  would make a fine addition to the Federation."
Patterns  Of Force ,"16 Feb, 1968 ",52,"Captain, I never will understand humans. How  could a man as brilliant, a mind as logical as John Gill's, have made  such a fatal error?"

The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"Commodore Wesley. How do you do, sir?"
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"The most ambitious computer complex ever created. Its purpose is  to correlate all computer activity aboard a starship, to provide the  ultimate in vessel operation and control."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"I hold an A-7 computer expert classification, Commodore. I'm  well acquainted with Doctor Daystrom's theories and discoveries. The  basic design of all our ship's computers are Doctor Daystrom's."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,We are attempting to prove it can run this ship more efficiently  than man.
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,The most unfortunate lack in current computer programming is  that there is nothing available to immediately replace the starship  surgeon.
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"I am honoured, Doctor."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"Fascinating, Doctor. This computer has a potential beyond  anything you've ever done. Even your breakthrough in duotronics did not  have the promise of this."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"The M-5 has been perfected, Commander. Its potential is a fact."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"If I can be of assistance, Doctor."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,M-5 has performed admirably so far.
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"Captain, I am forced to agree with Doctor Daystrom. With the  course information plotted into it, his computer could have brought us  here as easily as the navigator. In fact, it might have been a further  demonstration of M-5's capability."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"Enjoy, Captain? No. I'm merely gratified to see Doctor  Daystrom's new unit execute everything required of it in such a highly  efficient manner. M-5 is another distinguished triumph for his career."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"The planet is class M, Captain. Oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere  suitable for human life support. Two major land masses, a number of  islands, life form readings."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"M-5's readout, Captain."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"Captain, the computer does not judge. It makes logical  selections."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"I am not familiar with these instruments, Doctor. You are using  an entirely new type of control mechanism. However, it appears to me  this unit is drawing more power than before."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"Doctor, this unit is not a human body. The computer can process  information, but only the information which is put into it."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"Captain, sensors report two contacts now. One on the port bow,  one on the stern. Distance, two hundred  thousand kilometres and closing."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,We are not scheduled for war games in this area. This may be a  surprise attack as a problem for the M-5.
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"Phaser hit on port deflector four, Captain."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,Attacking vessels are moving off.
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,Minor hit on deflector screen four. No appreciable damage.
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"The ship reacted more rapidly than human control could have  manoeuvred her. Tactics, deployment of weapons, all indicate an immense  sophistication in computer control."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"Practical, Captain? Perhaps. But not desirable. Computers make  excellent and efficient servants, but I have no wish to serve under  them. Captain the starship also runs on loyalty to one man, and nothing  can replace it, or him."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"Dunsel, Doctor, is a term used by midshipmen at Starfleet  Academy. It refers to a part which serves no useful purpose."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,Unidentified. This is not a drill.
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"M-5 has identified her, Captain. The Woden. Listed in Starfleet  Registry as an old-style ore freighter converted to automation. No  crew. Coming into visual range."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"No effect on any of the M-5 controls, Captain."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"Captain, photon torpedoes locking on target. Full power."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"All systems report normal, Captain."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"I would say, Captain, that M-5 is not only capable of taking  care of this ship, it is also capable of taking care of itself."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"M-5 appears drawing power directly from the warp engines,  tapping the matter-antimatter reserves."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"The multitronic unit is drawing more and more power directly  from the warp engines. The computer now controls all helm, navigation,  and engineering functions."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,There is one possibility. The automatic helm navigation circuit  relays might be disrupted from engineering level three.
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"Most illogical. Of all people, he should have known how the  computer would perform. Of course, the M-5 itself has not behaved  logically."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,No. But it is interesting.
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,Good.
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"Mister Scott is ready to apply the circuit disrupter. As he does  so, I shall trip the manual override into control."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"Manual override is in control, Captain."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,Mister Chekov.
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"Thank you, Ensign."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"It appears, Captain, we've been doing  what used to be called pursuing a wild goose. M-5 has rerouted helm and  navigational controls, bypassing this primary system."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"I believe that when M-5 discovered our tampering, it rerouted  the controls, leaving this one active by simply sending through an  electronic impulse at regular intervals."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,I do not know. It is not performing in a logical manner.
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"I do not mean to offend, sir, but it behaves with an almost  human pattern."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"Attack force closing rapidly, breaking formation, attacking at  will."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,Hit on the Lexington.
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,Hit in engineering section. Possible damage to her impulse  engines. She's still maneuverable on warp drive.
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"The Excalibur, a direct hit."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,Lexington hit again.
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"Probably true, Captain. It works faster, thinks faster than we  do. It is a human mind amplified by the instantaneous relays possible  in a computer."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"Doctor Daystrom, you impressed human engrams on the M-5  circuits."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,Then perhaps you could talk to the unit. M-5 has no reason to  believe you would harm it.
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"I am most impressed with the technology, Captain. Doctor  Daystrom has created a mirror image of his mind."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,Fascinating.
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"Every living thing wants to survive, Captain. Daystrom must have  impressed that instinctive reaction upon the computer."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,Commodore Wesley is a dedicated commander. I should regret  serving aboard the instrument of his death.
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"Captain, attack force almost within phaser range."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,M-5 is leaving itself open to attack. The machine is committing  suicide to atone for the sin of murder.
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"The force field is gone, Captain. M-5 is  neutralised."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,I would say his multitronic unit is in approximately the same  condition.
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"Captain, why did you feel the attacking ships would not fire  when they saw the Enterprise apparently vulnerable? Logically, that is  the sort of trap M-5 should have set."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"No, Doctor. I simply maintain that computers are more efficient  than human beings, not better."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"I presume your question is meant to offer me a choice between  machines and human beings, and I believe I have already answered that  question."
The  Ultimate Computer ,"8 Mar, 1968 ",53,"It would be most interesting to impress your memory engrams on a  computer, Doctor. The resulting torrential flood of illogic would be  most entertaining."
The  Omega Glory ,"1 Mar, 1968 ",54,"We're locked onto the Exeter's engineering  section, Captain."
The  Omega Glory ,"1 Mar, 1968 ",54,Captain.
The  Omega Glory ,"1 Mar, 1968 ",54,As if they were in them when
The  Omega Glory ,"1 Mar, 1968 ",54,Lieutenant Galloway and I are checking out  the lower levels. There seems to be no one aboard. Only uniforms.
The  Omega Glory ,"1 Mar, 1968 ",54,Fascinating.
The  Omega Glory ,"1 Mar, 1968 ",54,"Aye, sir."
The  Omega Glory ,"1 Mar, 1968 ",54,"I have their surgeon's log, Captain. Their last log entry,  Captain, on screen."
The  Omega Glory ,"1 Mar, 1968 ",54,Interesting that the villagers know about phasers.
The  Omega Glory ,"1 Mar, 1968 ",54,"A Yang lance, Doctor."
The  Omega Glory ,"1 Mar, 1968 ",54,Bruised only. We were approximately one hundred metres from the  village when five of the savages ambushed us. We managed to escape  without firing.
The  Omega Glory ,"1 Mar, 1968 ",54,"Captain Tracey is being quite factual in several statements.  One, the Yangs are totally contemptuous of death. They seem incredibly  vicious. Two, he is also being factual in that the Yangs are massing  for an attack. There are signs of thousands of them in the foothills  beyond. However, he was less than truthful in one very important  matter."
The  Omega Glory ,"1 Mar, 1968 ",54,Captain Tracey's reserve belt packs. Empty. Found among the  remains of several hundred Yang bodies.
The  Omega Glory ,"1 Mar, 1968 ",54,"A smaller attack on this village a week ago, driven off by  Captain Tracey with his phaser. I have found villagers who will  corroborate it."
The  Omega Glory ,"1 Mar, 1968 ",54,"Regulations are quite harsh, but they're also quite clear,  Captain. If you do not act, you will be considered equally guilty."
The  Omega Glory ,"1 Mar, 1968 ",54,"I agree that formal charges have little meaning now. However,  you must at least confiscate his phaser."
The  Omega Glory ,"1 Mar, 1968 ",54,"Not that I have observed, Captain. Of course, should they wish  to do so, one could always rest while the other keeps you occupied."
The  Omega Glory ,"1 Mar, 1968 ",54,"Good, Captain. Try to reason with them. Keep trying, Captain.  Their behaviour is highly illogical."
The  Omega Glory ,"1 Mar, 1968 ",54,"I have tried, Captain.  {Storeroom]"
The  Omega Glory ,"1 Mar, 1968 ",54,"Captain, I have managed to loosen this grill  somewhat. If the mortar on yours is as old."
The  Omega Glory ,"1 Mar, 1968 ",54,Captain Tracey mentioned there was once a considerable  civilisation here. The only reasonable explanation would be a war.  Nuclear devastation or a bacteriological holocaust.
The  Omega Glory ,"1 Mar, 1968 ",54,"Yes, I heard, Captain."
The  Omega Glory ,"1 Mar, 1968 ",54,"Captain? Captain? Captain, are you able to respond?"
The  Omega Glory ,"1 Mar, 1968 ",54,"Seven hours and eight minutes, Captain."
The  Omega Glory ,"1 Mar, 1968 ",54,"We can contact the ship in a few moments, Captain, if I can  cross-circuit this unit."
The  Omega Glory ,"1 Mar, 1968 ",54,War created an imbalance and nature counterbalanced it.
The  Omega Glory ,"1 Mar, 1968 ",54,"Ready, Captain. Quite crude. Voice communication will not be  possible, but we can signal the ship."
The  Omega Glory ,"1 Mar, 1968 ",54,"I'm weak, Captain, but not in difficulty."
The  Omega Glory ,"1 Mar, 1968 ",54,"My need for attention is vital, Doctor, but our need for  departure is even more immediate."
The  Omega Glory ,"1 Mar, 1968 ",54,"Yes. I see, Captain. They would've learned to wear skins,  adopted stoic mannerisms, learned the bow and the lance."
The  Omega Glory ,"1 Mar, 1968 ",54,"Kohms? Communists? The parallel is almost too close, Captain. It  would mean they fought the war your Earth avoided, and in this case,  the Asiatics won and took over this planet."
The  Omega Glory ,"1 Mar, 1968 ",54,"I am open to suggestions, Doctor."
The  Omega Glory ,"1 Mar, 1968 ",54,I'm making a suggestion.
The  Omega Glory ,"1 Mar, 1968 ",54,"There's no question about his guilt, Captain, but does our  involvement here also constitute a violation of the Prime Directive?"
Assignment:  Earth ,"29 Mar, 1968 ",55,"It appears we have accidentally intercepted someone's  transporter beam, Captain."
Assignment:  Earth ,"29 Mar, 1968 ",55,"Captain, something is beaming aboard this  vessel."
Assignment:  Earth ,"29 Mar, 1968 ",55,The beam is originating at least one  thousand light years away.
Assignment:  Earth ,"29 Mar, 1968 ",55,"If what he says is true, Captain, every second we delay him  could be dangerous."
Assignment:  Earth ,"29 Mar, 1968 ",55,"A most difficult decision, Captain."
Assignment:  Earth ,"29 Mar, 1968 ",55,"Quite a lovely animal, Captain. I find myself strangely drawn to  it."
Assignment:  Earth ,"29 Mar, 1968 ",55,"He did say his planet was hidden, Captain."
Assignment:  Earth ,"29 Mar, 1968 ",55,"Current Earth crises would fill a tape bank, Captain. There will  be an important assassination today, an equally dangerous government  coup in Asia, and, this could be highly critical, the launching of an  orbital nuclear warhead platform by the United States countering a  similar launch by other powers."
Assignment:  Earth ,"29 Mar, 1968 ",55,"Most definitely. Once the sky was full of orbiting H-bombs, the  slightest mistake could have brought one down by accident,  setting off a nuclear holocaust."
Assignment:  Earth ,"29 Mar, 1968 ",55,"He might be inclined to prepare a perfect one, Captain. But then  again he may be telling the truth."
Assignment:  Earth ,"29 Mar, 1968 ",55,"Following him down is a major risk, Captain. If we ourselves do  anything that changes history"
Assignment:  Earth ,"29 Mar, 1968 ",55,"In here, Captain."
Assignment:  Earth ,"29 Mar, 1968 ",55,Chances are he's out of sight inside the rocket gantry or at one  of the control centres.
Assignment:  Earth ,"29 Mar, 1968 ",55,"Here, let me help you, Sergeant. It's operated with this dial  here."
Assignment:  Earth ,"29 Mar, 1968 ",55,"I can try, Captain."

Assignment:  Earth ,"29 Mar, 1968 ",55,"It is difficult to know which is best, Captain."
Assignment:  Earth ,"29 Mar, 1968 ",55,"Without facts, the decision cannot be made logically. You must  rely on your human intuition."
Assignment:  Earth ,"29 Mar, 1968 ",55,"Correction, Mister Seven. It appears we did not interfere. The  Enterprise was part of what was supposed to happen on this day in 1968."
Assignment:  Earth ,"29 Mar, 1968 ",55,And you'll be pleased our records show that it resulted in a new  and stronger international agreement against the use of such weapons.
Assignment:  Earth ,"29 Mar, 1968 ",55,"Captain, we could say that Mister Seven and Miss Lincoln have  some interesting experiences in store for them."
Assignment:  Earth ,"29 Mar, 1968 ",55,"Live long and prosper, Mister Seven."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,On mark eight and closing.
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,Fascinating.
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,A mechanical device of unknown properties. I read no life forms  aboard.
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"Obviously, it intends to intercept us. It has made several  course changes corresponding with our own."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,Unclear whether it intends to attack or merely communicate with  us.
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,Indeed.
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"Vulcan, Captain."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,Unquestionably. Most impressive.
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"True telepaths can be most formidable, and we have been warned."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"No recorded contacts. If they ever ventured into space, they  evidently withdrew immediately."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"I prefer being a welcomed guest, Captain, but there seems to be  little choice."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"Unknown, Captain. Sensor readings give no indication of fog like  conditions in this area."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"Unknown, Captain. Unlike Mister Scott's transporter, this unit  is not functioning."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"No use, Captain. Obviously none of our devices will function.  Apparently that Melkotian buoy"
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,Fascinating.
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"Obviously this represents the Melkotian's concept of an American  frontier town, circa 1880."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,Perhaps the Melkotians have insufficient data about this era.
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,Crude but dangerous.
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"Captain, the Melkot said you were the pattern. He looked into  your mind and selected what he considered the proper time and place for  our punishment."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,Yes. The violence of your own heritage is to be the pattern for  our execution.
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"Precisely, in terms of what the Melkots intend for us."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,Are they really?
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"Captain, I pride myself on my knowledge of your Earth history.  The names were known in the annals of the opening of the western sector  of America. the United States of America, that is."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"And the Clanton gang. On October 26th, they had it out."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,History cannot be changed.
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"Is this a dead man, Doctor?"
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"Captain, since we have seen that death is the one reality in  this situation, I seriously suggest you reseat yourself immediately.  Without moving a muscle of either hand. If I remember correctly, that  would involve you in what was called the fast draw. It initiated  unfortunate events."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,I believe he was actually trying to provoke a dispute with  Mister Chekov.
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"I assure you, sir, we shall watch it, and everything, extremely  closely."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"The day is still young, Ensign."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"And if this is indeed some sort of replay of history, the Earps  will kill the Clantons at the OK Corral at five o'clock this afternoon."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"Impossible, Captain. In this century, there are no metal alloys  or power sources to make devices such as ours."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"Mister Chekov is involved, Captain."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,It is obvious the Melkotians are not going to permit us to leave  this town.
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"There's no way we can know where it is, Doctor."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,I could make a device to deliver it on target.
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,I shall need some fusing and cotton wadding.
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"I shall manufacture the equivalent of an ancient generating  canister, more familiarly known as a gas grenade."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,And it is not yet our time.
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"Gentlemen, there is one thing which requires the immediate  attention of all of us. Specifically, our future."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"I understand the feeling, Captain."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"My feelings are not a subject for discussion, Doctor."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"Captain, it's quite all right. They forget I am half human."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"Captain. I vaguely remember the historical account of the famous  battle in which we are about to engage, but I am confused."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"Since each of us represents members of the Clanton gang. You,  Ike Clanton, I, Frank McLowery, then Mister Chekov would be the other  Billy, would he not?"
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,But did not William Claiborne survive the battle at the OK  Corral?
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"Mister Chekov is dead. But in the actual gunfight, William  Claiborne survived."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,Another hour.
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,Not precisely.
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,It should.
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"Negotiating with them could buy us more time, Captain."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"It would be worth a try, at least until we're certain of the  device. Then perhaps we could quiet things down."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,These crude supplies we were forced to use  worked quite well.
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"Perhaps they would've been if they'd had your ingenuity, Doctor."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,Captain?
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,Right now.
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,It has not been tested.
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,But this is painless.
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,Fascinating.
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"Captain, you don't seem to understand. It did not function, but  it must function."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"A scientific fact But if the tranquilliser does not function,  which is clearly impossible, then a radical alteration of our thought  patterns must be in order."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,That may not be necessary.
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"A fact, Captain. Physical laws simply cannot be ignored.  Existence cannot be without them."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"I mean, Doctor, that we are faced with a staggering  contradiction. The tranquilliser you created should have been  effective."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"Exactly. Doctor, in your opinion, what killed Mister Chekov?"
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,Wrong. His mind killed him.
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"Physical reality is consistent with universal laws. Where the  laws do not operate, there is no reality. All of this is unreal."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"But you made your examination under conditions which we cannot  trust. We judge reality by the response of our senses.  Once we are convinced of the reality of a given situation, we abide by  its rules. We judged the bullets to be solid, the guns to be real,  therefore they can kill."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,He may indeed be dead. We do not know.
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"Exactly. I know the bullets are unreal, therefore they cannot  harm me."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,Precisely.
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,The smallest doubt would be enough to kill you.
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"Very well, sir. Engineer?"
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,Your mind to my mind. Your thoughts to my thoughts.
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"The bullets are unreal. Without body. They are  illusions only. Shadows without substance. They will not pass through  your body, for they do not exist."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,Captain.
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"Captain, the Melkotian object."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"The object is beginning to emit M-rays of a highly unstable  nature, Captain."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"Energy output increasing beyond measurable levels, Captain."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,Captain. May I ask a question? You needn't answer if it seems  too personal.
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"This afternoon, you wanted to kill, didn't you?"
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"But he wanted to, Doctor."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"Yes, Captain."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,"Mankind, ready to kill."
Spectre  Of The Gun ,"25 Oct, 1968 ",56,I wonder how humanity managed to survive.
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,"It's in a border area, Mister Scott. The Klingons also claim  jurisdiction."
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,Sounds typical of the Elasians. The scientists who made the  initial investigation reported the men were vicious and arrogant.
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,"Not without precedent, Captain. Remember that"
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,I am the first officer. This is Captain James Kirk.
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,"Captain, the Dohlman is dissatisfied with the quarters provided."
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,"I do not know, but all the Elasians seem most irrational."
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,"At first it appeared to be a sensor ghost,  but I've run checks on all the instrumentation. All the equipment is  functioning perfectly."
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,None in this area. Nothing that would account for it. The ghost  appears intermittently.
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,"None, Captain. Insufficient data."
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,"Captain, we had a momentary fix on the object enough to  establish it was a spaceship."
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,No data yet.
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,Our ghost has materialised.
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,"Negative, Captain. The Klingon ship has simply moved into  contact range. She is pacing us, precisely matching our sublight speed  and on a parallel course."
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,"Captain, your analysis of the situation was flawless,  anticipating that she would deny you admittance. However, the logic by  which you arrived at your conclusion escapes me."
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,"I have it on my sensor, Lieutenant."
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,May we see you a moment?
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,"Captain, are you all right?"
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,"It is true then, Captain?"
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,"Their speed is better than warp six, Captain."
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,I don't think they meant to attack us. We were very fortunate  this time.
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,Very. But why do the Klingons consider the possession of this  system so vital?
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,"I have another question, Captain. Is not the bridge the wrong  place for the Dohlman at a time like this?"
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,They demand an immediate reply.
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,We can still manoeuvre.
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,Help could not arrive before the Enterprise would be destroyed.
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,He's passed us. All shields held.
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,Better than warp seven.
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,He's past us again. Damage to number four shield.
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,"It will not withstand another full charge, Captain. I'm getting  some very peculiar energy readings."
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,She is the source.
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,The necklace.
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,"These are common stones?  See, Captain? Here and  here."
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,"No doubt, Captain."
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,"Captain, these are crude crystals. There is  no way to judge what the unusual shapes will do to the energy flow."
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,Damage to Klingon number three shield. Number four shield  obliterated. Loss of manoeuvre power.
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,"You are too late, Doctor. The Captain has found his own  antidote."
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,"The antidote to a woman of Elas, Doctor, is a starship. The  Enterprise infected the Captain long before the Dohlman did."
Elaan  of Troyius ,"20 Dec, 1968 ",57,"In this particular instance, Doctor, I agree with you."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"Astronomical, Captain. The relative size, age and composition of  this planet makes it highly improbable that it would evolve similarly  to Earth in any way."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"An alien metal of some kind. An alloy resistant to probe.  Readings can't even measure its age accurately. These incised symbols  are fascinating. Evidently, some form of writing."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"Negative, Captain. Structures of this complexity require  extremely sophisticated building apparatus, the kind usually found in  cultures surpassing or equalling our own."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,Bearing one one seven mark four.
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"If we are to divert the asteroid which is on a collision course  with this planet, we must warp out of orbit within thirty minutes.  Every second we delay arriving at the deflection point compounds the  problem, perhaps past solution."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"Yes, sir."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"They are, Doctor. A mixture of Navajo, Mohican, and Delaware, I  believe. All among the more advanced and peaceful tribes."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"Highly improbable, Captain. Sensor probes indicate only one type  of life form here."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"Too primitive to grasp the concept of space flight, Doctor. Our  appearance here would only confuse and frighten them."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,Doctor?
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,I suggest that any further research on your part be delayed  until after we have diverted the asteroid.
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,Spock to Enterprise.
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"Prepare to beam us up, Mister Scott. We're warping out of orbit."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"Doctor, that asteroid is almost as large as your Earth's moon.  Far enough away, the angle necessary to divert it enough to avoid  destruction is minute, but as the asteroid approaches this planet, the  angle becomes so great that even the power of a starship"
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"If we arrive at the deflection point in time, it may not get  here at all."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"Once the asteroid has been diverted, we'll return here and  resume the search."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"Doctor, assume  this is the planet we're on. This is the approaching asteroid. If we  don't get to that deflection point in time, it will become physically  impossible to divert this asteroid. In that case, everyone on this  planet will die, including the captain."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"In the time it's taken me to explain the problem, the asteroid  has moved from here to here. The longer we delay, the less the  likelihood of being able to divert it. Beam us up, Mister Scott."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"Stress or not, we cannot reduce speed. I do  not intend to miss that"
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"Objection noted, Mister Scott. Carry on."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,Then bypass the relays and go to manual control.
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"I want full power, Mister Scott."

The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,Prepare to activate deflectors.
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"Engineering, maintain full power. Full power."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,Not now.
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,Activate deflectors.
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"Degree of deflection, Mister Sulu."

The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"Correct, Mister Chekov. I intend to retreat in front of that  asteroid until we can employ all power on phaser beams."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,To destroy it. A narrow beam concentrated on a single spot will  split that mass.
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,Incorrect. We'll still be able to get out of its path by use of  impulse power.
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"That, Doctor, is another calculated risk we must take."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"Co-ordinates, Mister Chekov."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,That is our target. The asteroid's weakest point.
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"Lock all phasers on that mark. Maximum intensity, narrow beam. I  want to split that fissure wide open."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"Very astute, Doctor."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,We'll fire in sequence and continue firing as long as Mister  Scott can maintain power.
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,Fire phasers.
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"Rig for simultaneous firing, Mister Sulu. Commence simultaneous  bombardment."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,Estimated repair time?  {Engineering]
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"I've already surmised that. Thank you, Mister Scott."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"I accept the responsibility, Doctor."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"Mister Chekov, resume heading eight eight three mark four one."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"Exactly fifty nine point two two three days, Doctor, and that  asteroid will be four hours behind us all the way."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"Another calculated Vulcan risk, Doctor."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"There isn't time, Doctor. I must decipher those obelisk's  symbols. They're a highly advanced form of cipher writing."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"I'm aware of that, Doctor. I'm also aware when we arrive at the  planet, we'll have barely four hours to effect rescue. I believe those  symbols are the key."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"I am not hungry, Doctor. And under stress, we Vulcans can do  without sleep for weeks."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"My physical condition is not important, Doctor. That obelisk is."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"You prescribed rest, Doctor. The symbols on the obelisk are not  words. They are musical notes."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"In a way, yes. Other cultures, among them certain Vulcan  offshoots, use musical notes as words. The tones correspond roughly to  an alphabet."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"Yes. The obelisk is a marker, just as I thought. It was left by  a super-race known as the Preservers. They passed through the galaxy  rescuing primitive cultures which were in danger of extinction and  seeding them, so to speak, where they could live and grow."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,So have I. Apparently the Preservers account for a number of  them.
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,Which has now become defective and is failing to operate.
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"Precisely, Doctor."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,Spock to Enterprise.
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,We've located the captain. Beam down Nurse Chapel with an  emergency surgical kit.
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,Hallucinations?
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,The nurse has given you something to ease the pain. Why were you  being stoned?
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"Naturally, since he did not come from there."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"Time, Doctor McCoy, is the one thing we do not have in  abundance.  Spock here."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"Report noted. Doctor, is he strong enough for the Vulcan mind  fusion?"
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"I am Spock. You are James Kirk. Our minds are moving closer.  Closer, closer, closer, James Kirk. Closer."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,James Kirk.
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,Our minds are one.
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,I am Kir
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,Spock!
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,His mind. He is an extremely dynamic individual.
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"Captain, were you inside this structure?"
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"This obelisk is one huge deflector mechanism. It is imperative  that we get inside immediately. Captain, we do not have much time."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"If we are not able to gain entry and activate the deflector  mechanism within the next fifty minutes, this entire planet will be  destroyed."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"I already have to some extent, Captain. They are musical notes."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,That would be one method. Another would be a series of tonal  qualities spoken in their proper sequence.
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"If you could remember your exact words, Captain."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"It is similar to deflector panels I've seen,  Captain, but far more complicated."
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,Probably a memory beam. You must have activated it out of  sequence.
The  Paradise Syndrome ,"4 Oct, 1968 ",58,"I do have an excellent eye for musical notes, Captain. They  would seem to indicate that this series of relays activated in their  proper"
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,I did give a full report
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,"No, sir. Compliance presents no problem."
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,"Sensor scan to one half parsec. Negative, Captain."
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,Increasing sensor scan to one parsec. All scanners report clear.  Nothing in our immediate vicinity.
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,Intelligence reports Romulans now using Klingon design.
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,"A second ship has appeared.  Correction,  there are now three. We are surrounded."
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,"I have a theory, Captain."
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,"True, Captain. That would be standard Romulan procedure."
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,It would be a great prize.
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,I believe the Romulans have developed a cloaking device which  renders our tracking sensors useless.
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,"If we had not crossed the Neutral Zone, on your order, you would  not now need our opinions to support a decision which should never have  had to be made."
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,Spock.
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,I understand.
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,Starfleet is not in the habit of informing Romulans of its  ships' personnel.
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,It is no myth.
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,I reserve the privilege of speaking only when it will not  violate my honour as a Vulcan.
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,"You're being clever, Commander. That is unworthy of a Romulan.  It is not a lie to keep the truth to oneself."
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,"You would not resort to them, Commander. They would prove  ineffective against the captain."
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,I cannot allow the captain to be further destroyed. The strain  of command has worn heavily upon him. He's not been himself for several  weeks.
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,"As you can see, Captain Kirk is a highly sensitive and emotional  person. I believe he has lost the capacity for rational decision."
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,I'm betraying no secrets. The commander's suspicion that  Starfleet ordered the Enterprise into the Neutral Zone is unacceptable.  Our rapid capture demonstrates its foolhardiness.
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,"I am speaking the truth for the benefit of the Enterprise and  the Federation. I say now and for the record, that Captain Kirk ordered  the Enterprise across the Neutral Zone on his own initiative and his  craving for glory."
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,He is not sane.
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,I am half Vulcan. My mother is a human.
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,Vulcan.
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,Eighteen years.
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,The question is irrelevant.
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,My duty as an officer is to obey him.
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,I do not desire a ship of my own.
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,Such opportunities are extremely rare.
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,That thought has occasionally crossed my mind.
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,"Commander, shall we speak plainly? It is you who desperately  need a ship. You want the Enterprise."
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,Indeed.
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,"I am honoured, Commander. Are the guards also invited?"
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,Of course. I shall obey your restrictions.
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,It would be illogical to assume that all conditions remain  stable.
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,I am ready.
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,"The matter is not open for discussion, Doctor."
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,"There is no alternative, Doctor. The safety of the crew is now  the paramount issue. It is misguided loyalty to resist any further."
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,I was unprepared for his attack. I instinctively used the Vulcan  death grip.
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,"I am very flattered, Commander. There's no doubt that the  cuisine aboard your vessel is far superior to that of the Enterprise.  It is indeed a very powerful recruiting inducement."
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,A place?
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,I was not aware of that aspect of Romulan society.
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,Please believe me. I do appreciate it.
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,"Yes, of course, but not just this moment. An hour from now will  do even better. Would it not, Commander?"
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,I was beginning to wonder.
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,"How rare, and how beautiful. But so incongruous when spoken by a  soldier."
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,Spock to Captain Kirk.
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,Captain
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,"Yes, Captain. The cloaking device is in an  area near the commander's quarters. It is closely guarded and  off-limits to all but authorised personnel. What is your present  location?"
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,"Unknown, Captain. At present, I am rather  heavily"
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,"Commander, your attire is not only more appropriate, it should  actually stimulate our conversation."
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,I must confess that I too am moved emotionally. I know it is  illogical.
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,"That will be profitless, Commander. I do not believe you will  find it."
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,I assure you I am quite sane.
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,"First officer of the Enterprise.  What is your present form of execution?   Captain's log, stardate 5027.4. Commander Scott has  less than fifteen minutes to install the Romulan's cloaking device and  get it working. I hope Mister Spock can buy us the time we need."
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,I demand the Right of Statement first.
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,"Thank you. I shall not require much time. No more than twenty  minutes, I should say."
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,"My crime is sabotage. I freely admit my guilt.  The oath I swore as a Starfleet officer is both  specific and binding. As long as I wear the uniform, my duty is to  protect the security of the Federation. Clearly, your new cloaking  device is a threat to that security. I carried out my duty."
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,There is no regulation regarding the content of my statement.  May I continue?
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,"Beyond the historic tradition of Vulcan  loyalty, there is also the combined Romulan-Vulcan history of obedience  to duty."
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,"One hundred and fifty thousand kilometres, Captain, and closing  very rapidly."
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,One hundred thousand kilometres. They should commence firing at  us within the next twelve point seven seconds.
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,"The cloaking device is working perfectly, and the commander has  informed me that even the Romulan sensors cannot track a vessel so  equipped."
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,Deck two. It is regrettable that you were  made an unwilling passenger. It was not intentional. All the Federation  wanted was the cloaking device.
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,It was my only interest when I boarded your vessel.
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,"You underestimate yourself, Commander."
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,Obviously. Military secrets are the most fleeting of all. I hope  that you and I exchanged something more permanent.
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,It was the only choice possible. You would not respect any  other.
The  Enterprise Incident ,"27 Sep, 1968 ",59,"Captain, please go. Somehow they do not look aesthetically  agreeable"
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,Humans do have an amazing capacity for believing what they  choose and excluding that which is painful.
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,The attack on Professor Starnes' party must surely have been  unprovoked.
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,"I stand corrected, Captain. Induced would be a more precise  term. Induced by an outside force."
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,The release of bacteria. Or a helpless mental depression and a  state of suicidal anxiety could have been chemically induced.
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,"I do not know, but it is possible."
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,"A valid assumption, I would say."
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,Or the promise of reward.
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,"At present, yes.  Odd."
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,There seems to be some disturbance coming from that cave.
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,"Definitely not humanoid, Captain. Impossible to make any  specific identification. The readings do not correlate with any known  information."
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,"I'm not aware of it, Captain."
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,"I am not familiar with anxiety, but I wasn't aware it could be  registered on sensors."
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,"Are you all right, Captain?"
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,"Captain, I have extracted the salient portion of  Professor Starnes' tapes."
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,"Among the technical facts he gathered, Professor Starnes also  offered some rather unscientific hypotheses."
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,"There is another portion, Captain, which I believe you'll find  particularly interesting."
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,Unknown.
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,"He never completed the entry, and the dispatch was never sent.  Except for scenes of family life, games and picnics with the children,  that is the complete record. Whatever overwhelmed them must have done  so with incredible speed. Otherwise, the professor would have provided  details of the experience. He was an excellent scientist and tireless  in his pursuit of the truth."
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,"Possible, Captain. Evil does seek to maintain power by  suppressing the truth."
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,"According to the legend, Triacus was the seat of a band of  marauders who made constant war throughout the system of Epsilon Indi.  After many centuries, the destroyers were themselves destroyed by those  they had preyed upon."
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,"No, like so many legends, this one too has a frightening ending.  It warns that the evil is awaiting a catalyst to set it again into  motion and send it marauding across the galaxy."
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,"I was speaking of a legend, Captain."
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,"According to Federation records, this is the first."
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,"He said an unseen force was influencing him, that he recognised  it, was beginning to fight it and cancelled his request for a ship."
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,I am unable to lock on to the proper co-ordinates.
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,It appears we are no longer orbiting Triacus.
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,"Captain, we are no longer orbiting Triacus."
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,"Captain, why are we bothering Starfleet?"
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,This bridge is under complete control.
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,There is no need.
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,"I cannot obey your order, Captain."
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,"Captain, we must get off this bridge."
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,Captain.
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,Jim.
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,"Correct, Captain."
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,"Where to, Captain?"
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,"Captain, so long as the children are present, there is danger.  They are the carriers."
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,"They are followers. Without followers, evil cannot spread."
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,"Captain, the four hundred and thirty men and women on board the  Enterprise and the ship itself are endangered by these children."
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,"Perhaps that is true, but the evil that is within them is  spreading fast, and unless we can find a way to remove it"
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,You take from those who do not know you.
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,Why should you fear it?
And  The Children Shall Lead ,"11 Oct, 1968 ",60,"Tommy's father would have destroyed you, but he recognised you  too late."
Spock's  Brain ,"20 Sep, 1968 ",61,"Configuration unidentified. Ion propulsion, high velocity,  though of a unique technology."
Spock's  Brain ,"20 Sep, 1968 ",61,"One. Humanoid or similar. Low level of activity. Life-support  systems functioning. Interior atmosphere, conventional nitrogen-oxygen.  Instruments indicate a transferal beam emanating from the area of the  humanoid life form."
Spock's  Brain ,"20 Sep, 1968 ",61,"Directed at the Bridge of the Enterprise, Captain."
Spock's  Brain ,"20 Sep, 1968 ",61,Yes. Doctor McCoy.
Spock's  Brain ,"20 Sep, 1968 ",61,"If you will finish reconnecting my speech centre, I might be  able to help."
Spock's  Brain ,"20 Sep, 1968 ",61,"Yes. That's correct. One thing at a time. Ah, ah, mmm.  That's better. Now, Doctor. Try the sonic separator."
Spock's  Brain ,"20 Sep, 1968 ",61,"Yes, I believe I already have some sensation of feeling. Please  stimulate the nerve endings and observe the physical reactions, one by  one. In each case, I shall tell you when the probe is correct. You will  then seal using the tri-laser connector."
Spock's  Brain ,"20 Sep, 1968 ",61,Ready.
Spock's  Brain ,"20 Sep, 1968 ",61,Correct.
Spock's  Brain ,"20 Sep, 1968 ",61,Correct.

Spock's  Brain ,"20 Sep, 1968 ",61,"On the whole, Captain, I believe I am quite fit. Fascinating. A  remarkable example of a retrograde civilisation. At the peak, advanced  beyond any of our capabilities and now operating at this primitive  level which you saw. And it all began thousands of years ago when a  glacial age reoccurred.

Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,"Thank you, Mister Marvick. I shall be wearing the visor."
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,It has proved effective for Vulcans.
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,I shall endeavour to keep it under control.
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,"Welcome aboard, Ambassador Kollos. I am First Officer Spock."
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,"Captain Kirk, we are ready."
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,"Doctor Jones, may I congratulate you on your assignment with  Ambassador Kollos."
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,I'm sure you will find it a fascinating experience.
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,No one ever has. I was referring to mind-links I had attempted  with members of other species.
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,I was unable to accept. My life is here.
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,Spock to Bridge. We have arrived at the Ambassador's quarters.
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,I would appreciate an opportunity to exchange greetings with the  Ambassador.
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,I almost envy you your assignment.
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,"Not correct, Doctor, although I am aware of your mind attempting  to contact mine. Were you born a telepath?"
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,I understand. May I show you to your quarters?
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,I understand. Our ship's surgeon often makes the same complaint.  Do call when you are ready.
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,"Why, thank you, Captain."
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,"On the contrary, Doctor, I would say that Doctor Jones was  indeed fortunate."
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,"Doctor Jones was born a telepath, Captain."
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,What most humans generally find impossible to understand is the  need to shut out the bedlam of other people's thoughts and emotions.
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,"As a matter of fact, I wear it this evening to honour you,  Doctor."
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,"I see, Doctor McCoy, you still subscribe to the outmoded notion,  promulgated by your ancient Greeks, that what is good must also be  beautiful."
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,I'll escort you to your quarters.
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,"I genuinely intended to honour her, Captain. Good evening,  gentlemen."
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,Do you know whether he saw the Medusan?
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,"Then insanity will surely be the result, Captain. Dangerous  insanity."
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,"Trying, Captain. Mister Chekov, your assistance, please."
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,"We are evidently far outside our own galaxy, judging from the  lack of traceable reference points. When we exceeded warp speed factor  nine point five, we apparently entered a space-time continuum."
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,"Impossible to calculate. We lack data to analyse. Our  instruments appear to be functioning normally, but what they tell us  makes no sense. Our records are clear up to the point at which we left  our galaxy."
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,"Unfortunately, we lack reference points on which to plot a  return course. We experienced extreme sensory distortion,  and we shall do so again if we attempt to use warp speed. And we cannot  re-cross the barrier using sub light speed."
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,"An entertaining suggestion, Mister Chekov, but not very helpful."
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,Very possibly. The Medusan sensory system is radically different  from ours. Perhaps for the purpose of this emergency I might become  Kollos.
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,A fusion. A mind-link to create a double entity. Each of us  would enjoy the knowledge and sensory capabilities of both. We will  function as one being.
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,"If the link is successful there will be a tendency to lose  separate identity. A necessary risk. Of course, Doctor Jones will not  wish to give me permission to accomplish the mind-link."
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,"Doctor Jones has shown reluctance every time I've asked to  converse with Kollos. In some ways, she is still most human, Captain,  particularly in the depth of her jealousy."
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,"Not sufficient. Her telepathic powers are formidable. If it is  at all possible, her mind must be so engaged that no thought of what I  am doing shall intrude."
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,The Enterprise is at stake. It is not possible for you to be  involved.
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,"This is not a duty that you can assume. I am aware of the fact  that your telepathic competence might be superior to mine, but there's  a more important factor. The object is to pilot this ship. That is  something you cannot do."
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,Fascinating.
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,"Evidently a highly sophisticated sensor web. My compliments to  you, and to your dressmaker."

Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,"This is delightful. I know you. All of you. James Kirk, Captain  and friend for many years. And Leonard McCoy, also of long  acquaintance. And Uhura, whose name means freedom.   She walks in beauty, like the  night."

Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,"In part. That is, part of us is known to you as Kollos. Ah,  Miranda. There you are.   O brave new world, that has such creatures  in  it."
Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,"My world is next for us. Captain Kirk, I speak for all of us you  call Medusans. I am sorry for the trouble I've brought to your ship."

Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,Co-ordination is completed.

Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,"How compact your bodies are. And what a variety of senses you  have. This thing you call language though, most remarkable. You depend  on it for so very much. But is any one of you really its master? But  most of all, the aloneness.  You are so alone. You live out your lives in this shell of flesh.  Self-contained, separate. How lonely you are. How terribly lonely."

Is  There In Truth No Beauty? ,"18 Oct, 1968 ",62,You're a wise Captain.

The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,Dust. Apparently these instruments have not  been recently used.
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"At that rate, it will take exactly seventy  four point one solar hours for the storm to pass."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"Remember, Captain, what we see on this tape happened  approximately three months ago."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"Negative, Captain. It doesn't register."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"Exactly one two one point three two metres beneath the planet  surface, Captain."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"Residual energy readings indicate we were beamed here by a  matter-energy scrambler, similar to our own transporter mechanism."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"Captain, picking up a life-form reading bearing four two mark  seven."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"Negative. Although humanoid, it is definitely not Homo Sapiens."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,Impossible. I can make no exact identification other than it  being humanoid.
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"Approaching the life-form, Captain."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,Still undistinguishable.
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"The sand-bats of Manark Four appear to be inanimate rock  crystals, Doctor, until they attack."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"From what we know of the specific gravity and other  environmental factors of this planet, a life-form such as hers could  not evolve here."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"An unlikely possibility, Captain, since over ninety eight  percent of the known telepathic species send thoughts as well as  receive them. She's made no attempt to contact our minds."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"Gem, Doctor?"
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"Correct, Captain."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"Captain, in that direction, my tricorder is now picking up a  substantial collection of objects."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,Electronically sophisticated devices. I fail to understand why  my tricorder previously gave no indication of them being out there.
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,Fascinating.
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,Readings indicate the passage to the surface lies in this  direction.
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"Research station six kilometres in that direction, Captain."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,Just ahead.
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"I believe they were never actually present, Doctor. It was a  mirage."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"Captain, it was a mirage."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"Captain, I request permission to be allowed"
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"Doctor, I'm unable to lock in on the previous readings. I can  find no exit out of here."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"Her withdrawal seemed to suggest the fear of death, Doctor. Only  your urging her on caused her to continue."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"Can you recall what happened, Captain?"
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"Captain, I noted that a light preceded you at the moment you  were returned here from the Vian's laboratory."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,I conclude such a light is an energy transfer point linking this  device to the power source.
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"If I can determine the frequency at which this device operates,  I might be able to cause it to function for us."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,I would say so.
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"I do not know, Captain. I'm beginning to understand its  operating principles, but that is all."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,Some men spend the majority of their lives in mines beneath the  surface.
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"I've recorded my principles and theories on the tricorder,  Doctor. Should the Vians return, there is sufficient data for you and  the captain to complete the adjustments."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"Possibly not, but you and the captain together will be able to  do so."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"How long will he be asleep, Doctor?"
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"I'm not criticizing your action, Doctor. On the contrary, I'm  quite grateful for it. The captain will be spared the strain of making  so difficult a decision. You have simplified the situation  considerably."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"While the captain is asleep, I am in command. When the Vians  return, I shall go with them."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,Precisely. The choice would have been the captain's. Now it is  mine.
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,Your action is highly unethical. My decision stands.
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"I was convinced in the same way you were, Captain. By the good  doctor's hypo."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"Hmm. A most unusual device. It is a control unit, but not a  control mechanism. In fact, it is not a mechanical device."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"This control is attuned to one electrical pattern of energy, the  pattern produced by the mental impulses of the person who possesses it.  It is activated solely by mental commands."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"I shall attempt to do so. However, it is not possible to adjust  the control to fit more than one pattern at a time. I am, of course,  most familiar with my own pattern. Therefore, with your permission, I"
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,Fascinating. They must have known we were capable of  comprehending this control and making use of it.
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,The only logical assumption is that they wish to let us go.
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"That is evidently their intention, Captain."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"Indeed, the facts would indicate that she's essential to their  purpose."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"Completed, Captain. The adjustments are delicate. They may not  survive more than even one use. However, there should be sufficient  energy to transfer us to the Enterprise."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,If you so desire.
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,Severe heart damage. Signs of congestion in both lungs. Evidence  of massive circulatory collapse.
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"He's dying, Jim. We can make him comfortable, but that is all."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,Internal injuries. Bleeding in the chest and abdomen.  Haemorrhage of the spleen and liver. Seventy percent kidney failure.
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,It could happen anytime.
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,I'm afraid not.
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"Uncertain, Captain. Dr. McCoy's analysis of her reaction assumes  that her instinct for self-preservation would prevent it. However, we  cannot be positive."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"What purpose can be served by the death of our friend, except to  bring you pleasure? Surely beings as advanced as yourselves know that  your star system will soon be extinct. Your sun will nova."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,Then you also know that the millions of inhabitants on its  planets are doomed.
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"You were correct, Captain. Everything that has occurred here has  been caused to happen by them. This has all been a great laboratory,  and we have been the subjects of the test."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"Captain, Dr. McCoy's life is not solely dependent on Gem. The  Vians too must be capable of saving his life."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,Captain?
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,The intensity of emotion is draining us and building up the  force field.
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"It draws its energy from us, Captain. In spite of what we see,  all emotion must be suppressed. That might weaken the field."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,It is complete. Gem has earned the right of survival for her  planet. She offered her life.
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"What is puzzling you, Captain?"
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"Captain, the element of chance can virtually be eliminated by a  civilisation as advanced as the Vians."
The  Empath ,"6 Dec, 1968 ",63,"Possibly, Captain. I shall certainly give the thought all the  consideration it is due."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"Captain, we are registering very curious readings from all  sensors."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"I cannot. According to our instruments, space itself is  literally breaking up. There is no known phenomenon which would account  for these readings."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,Negative. I have run a complete check on all systems.
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,Fascinating.
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"There is virtually no sensor contact. No mass analysis. No trace  of radiation. We see it, but our sensors indicate it is not there."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"Absolutely no record of such an occurrence, Ensign."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"The ship is still functioning, Captain. It is logical to assume  the mutineers are somewhere aboard."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"Captain, there is no sign of life aboard this vessel."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"Captain, the Defiant's sensors correspond  with an extremely high degree of correlation to those of the  Enterprise."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,Affirmative.
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"Request permission to remain, Captain. I could be completing the  data."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"Captain, there is a chance"
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,Energise.
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,Negative.
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,Compute the next period of spatial interphase.
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"We must try, Mister Scott. The fabric of space is very weak  here. If we disturb it, there will be no chance of retrieving the  Captain alive."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"Well, picture it this way, Mister Chekov. We exist in a universe  which co-exists with a multitude of others in the same physical space.  At certain brief periods of time, an area of their space overlaps an  area of ours. That is a time of interphase, during which we can connect  with the Defiant's universe."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"Yes. However, the dimensional structure of each universe is  totally dissimilar. Any use of power disturbs it. If we are not  extremely careful, we shall lose the Captain and become trapped  ourselves."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,Chekov! Chekov!
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,Security guards to the Bridge.
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,I was attempting to explain to Mister Chekov the nature of our  problems in this situation when he attacked.
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,Lieutenant Uhura is correct. There was murderous fury in Chekov.  The same fury which was evident in the Defiant.
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,Is there anything you need to isolate the cause?
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"If we are to recover the Captain, we must not move."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,Approximately two hours before the attempt can be made.
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"The Captain was caught in our transporter beam when the Defiant  phased out. It is possible he was spared the shock of transition and  survived. However, if we are to recover him, we must catch him at the  precise moment during the next interphase, or he will die. And there  can be no margin for error. His environmental unit can provide  breathable air for no more than three point six two hours."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"Status, Mister Sulu."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"Lieutenant Uhura, signal Red Alert."

The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,We are not interested in your display of force. The Enterprise  is responding to a distress signal from one of our ships and is  currently engaged in rescue operations. Do you wish to assist us?
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,The other ship is interspatially trapped. It should reappear in  one hour and fifty three minutes. We request you stand by until then.

The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,Spock here.
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"Theoretically it already has happened,  Doctor."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"I did, Doctor. The space was disturbed by  the Tholians."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,I shall have to recalculate to determine  when the next interphase will occur. They do not take place at regular  intervals.
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"I have confidence that you will soon isolate the cause, Doctor,  and prevent further spread of the affliction."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,The renowned Tholian punctuality.
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"Engineering, hold power steady and cut off all unnecessary  expenditures. Mister Sulu, divert all but emergency maintenance power  to the shields."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,Spock here.
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"Understood. Lieutenant Uhura, open a channel to the Tholian  ship. Mister Sulu, lock in phaser tracking controls."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"Ready, Mister Sulu?"
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,Fire.
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"Engineering, status report. Mister Scott?"
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,Can you estimate minimum time required for repair?
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,The decision to fight was logical. Lack of time prevented any  other course of action. The Tholian ship had to be disabled.
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"Doctor, I hardly believe this is the time for comparisons.  Please go to your laboratory and search for an antidote to the effects  of this space. That is your primary task, since we must remain here."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,Fascinating.
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"Negative. Lieutenant Uhura, can you open a channel to the  approaching vessel?"
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"Distance, Mister Sulu."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"Mister Sulu, I shall run an analysis on those filaments. Tie in  all sensors to the ship's library computer console.  Switch scanners."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"There's no analogy to this structure in Federation technology.  It is, however, an energy field, and if the Tholians are successful in  completing this structure before we have completed our repairs, we  shall not see home again."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"Doctor, your last report on an antidote on the effects of this  space was negative."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,The urgency requires your personal attention in the laboratory.
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"A few hours ago, the Captain elected to remain on board the  Defiant so that three members of this crew would have the best chance  of returning safely to the Enterprise. His concern was not only for  them, but for all the members of the crew of this ship. You all know  the sequence of events. We were fired upon by the Tholian ship. At that  time, Captain Kirk may have been alive. I deemed it necessary to return  the Tholian fire for the safety of the Enterprise. The Tholian ship has  been disabled. But as a result of the battle, we must accept the fact  that Captain Kirk is no longer alive."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,I shall not attempt to voice the quality of respect and  admiration which Captain Kirk commanded. Each of you must evaluate the  loss in the privacy of your own thoughts.
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"It can wait, Doctor. My duties require my immediate presence on  the bridge."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"It will wait for a more suitable moment, Doctor."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"The mental and physical state of this crew are your  responsibility, Doctor. At the moment, they are your top priority."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"We came here for a specific purpose, Doctor."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,The Captain would have remained to recover a crew member at the  risk of his own life or even his own ship.
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"I need not explain my rationale to you or any other member of  this crew. There is a margin of variation in any experiment. While  there was a chance, I was bound legally and morally to ascertain the  Captain's status."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"That is enough, Doctor. We both have other things to do."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,You will return to your duty as soon as we've discharged our  responsibilities here.
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"Doctor, I am in command of the Enterprise."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"If you believe I have acted irregularly, then relieve me of  duty. That is your prerogative as medical officer of this ship."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"What would you have me say, Doctor?"
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,Spock here.
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"I shall be there shortly. Doctor, I believe we each have our  respective tasks to complete before the Tholians complete theirs."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"Spock here. Proceed, Mister Scott."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,Report to Doctor McCoy all symptoms noted  prior to the attack.
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,Negative. We are relatively stable at the  moment.
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,Mister Scott?
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,Report to the bridge immediately.
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"In critical moments, men sometimes see exactly what they wish to  see."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"I was merely stating a fact, Doctor."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"Please leave that to me, Doctor McCoy. I realise that the crew  are your prime concern. You can best serve them in your laboratory. I  urge you to confine yourself to it until a remedy has been found."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"I understand, Doctor. I'm sure the Captain would simply have  said forget it, Bones."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,Captain? Captain? Captain.
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,Exactly. But the Captain remained. Only the overlap time  changed. The next interphase will occur here.
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,Can you be ready?
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"It will have to do, Mister Scott.  Come."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"You've found the antidote, Doctor."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,Ensign Chekov was affected so early. Has he responded to it?
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,Theragen? A nerve gas used by the Klingons.
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"If I remember correctly, it caused fatality only when used in  pure form."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"Welcome back, Lieutenant."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"Your absence was keenly felt, Mister Chekov."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,Estimated time for completion of the Tholian web.
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,Are the ships computers programmed for entry into interspace?
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,Spock to engineering.

The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,It will have to do.
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,Ready to transport on my order.
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,Try to maintain position Mister Sulu.
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"Engineering, bring ship's power up to full capability."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"Negative, Ensign. Utilising ship's power has thrown us clear of  it. Compute the distance from the original location."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"We shall soon see, Lieutenant."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"Good. Since the Captain was locked into our transporter beam  when we were thrown clear of the interphase area, he should've been  drawn here with us. Spock to transporter room."
The  Tholian Web ,"15 Nov, 1968 ",64,"Prepare to transport on the Captain's  co-ordinates on my order.   O'NEIL : Ready, Mister Spock."

For  The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky ,"8 Nov, 1968 ",65,"Yes, Captain?"
For  The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky ,"8 Nov, 1968 ",65,"Correct, Captain. We are approaching those co-ordinates."

For  The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky ,"8 Nov, 1968 ",65,"Negative, Captain. We've had that area on scanners constantly."

For  The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky ,"8 Nov, 1968 ",65,May I ask precisely what is troubling the doctor?
For  The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky ,"8 Nov, 1968 ",65,"Yes. I know of it, Captain."
For  The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky ,"8 Nov, 1968 ",65,"Very well, Doctor. The Captain and I seem to have suffered no  ill effects."
For  The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky ,"8 Nov, 1968 ",65,"Captain, informing these people they're on a ship may be in  violation of the Prime Directive of Starfleet Command."

The  Day Of The Dove ,"1 Nov, 1968 ",66,"Captain, neither the Klingon technology nor ours, is capable of  this. The instantaneous transmutation of matter. I doubt that they are  responsible."
The  Day Of The Dove ,"1 Nov, 1968 ",66,"None. However, if they had such power, would they not have used  it to create more effective weapons and only for themselves?"
The  Day Of The Dove ,"1 Nov, 1968 ",66,"Scans indicate that our forces and those of the Klingons are  exactly equal at thirty eight each. The Klingons control deck six and  starboard deck seven, while we control all sections above."
The  Day Of The Dove ,"1 Nov, 1968 ",66,"Most curious, Captain. There appear to be more life-energy units  on board than can be accounted for by the presence of the Enterprise  crew plus the Klingons. A considerable discrepancy."
The  Day Of The Dove ,"1 Nov, 1968 ",66,I shall attempt a compensatory reading of Klingon units.
The  Day Of The Dove ,"1 Nov, 1968 ",66,"No additional Klingons detected, Captain. It  is an alien life force, a single entity. I cannot ascertain its  location."

The  Day Of The Dove ,"1 Nov, 1968 ",66,What purpose?
The  Day Of The Dove ,"1 Nov, 1968 ",66,"If the alien is creating these events, Captain, it is apparently  capable of manipulating matter and mind."
The  Day Of The Dove ,"1 Nov, 1968 ",66,"Captain, I am constrained to point out that since minds are  evidently being influenced, we cannot know at this moment whether our  own memories are completely accurate and true."
The  Day Of The Dove ,"1 Nov, 1968 ",66,"An appropriate choice of terms. However, it is notoriously  difficult to arrange a truce with the Klingons once blood has been  drawn."
The  Day Of The Dove ,"1 Nov, 1968 ",66,"We are attempting to end it, Doctor. By reason, preferably.  There is an alien on board which may have created this situation."
The  Day Of The Dove ,"1 Nov, 1968 ",66,"Easy, Mister Scott."
The  Day Of The Dove ,"1 Nov, 1968 ",66,May I say that I have not thoroughly enjoyed serving with  humans? I find their illogic and foolish emotions a constant irritant.
The  Day Of The Dove ,"1 Nov, 1968 ",66,Fascinating. The result of stress?
The  Day Of The Dove ,"1 Nov, 1968 ",66,"Recent events would seem to be directed toward a magnification  of the basic hostilities between humans and Klingons. Apparently, it is  by design that we fight. We seem to be pawns."
The  Day Of The Dove ,"1 Nov, 1968 ",66,"It is most urgent that we locate the alien entity immediately,  and determine its motives and a method for halting its activities."

The  Day Of The Dove ,"1 Nov, 1968 ",66,It would appear that the entity wants us alive.
The  Day Of The Dove ,"1 Nov, 1968 ",66,Perhaps human and Klingon psychologies and combat capabilities  are being tested by an alien with designs on both powers.
The  Day Of The Dove ,"1 Nov, 1968 ",66,"I understand, Doctor. I, too, felt a brief surge of racial  bigotry. Most distasteful."
The  Day Of The Dove ,"1 Nov, 1968 ",66,Totally unfamiliar.
The  Day Of The Dove ,"1 Nov, 1968 ",66,"Fascinating. During Lieutenant Johnson's emotional outburst, his  expression of hatred and lust for vengeance, the alien's life energy  level increased. When the Lieutenant became unconscious, the alien lost  energy."
The  Day Of The Dove ,"1 Nov, 1968 ",66,"This one appears to be strengthened by mental irradiations of  hostility, violent intentions."
The  Day Of The Dove ,"1 Nov, 1968 ",66,"To put it simply. And it has acted as a catalyst, creating this  situation in order to satisfy that need. It has brought together  opposing forces, provided crude instruments in an effort to promote the  most violent mode of conflict."
The  Day Of The Dove ,"1 Nov, 1968 ",66,Then all hostile attitudes on board must be eliminated. The  fighting must end and soon.
The  Day Of The Dove ,"1 Nov, 1968 ",66,"The alien is affecting his mind, Captain. Soon, it will become  so powerful that none of us will be able to resist it."

Plato's  Stepchildren ,"22 Nov, 1968 ",67,How is the power transmitted?
Plato's  Stepchildren ,"22 Nov, 1968 ",67,Do these waves cease while you are asleep?
Plato's  Stepchildren ,"22 Nov, 1968 ",67,Thirty five.
Plato's  Stepchildren ,"22 Nov, 1968 ",67,Fascinating. I believe we're experiencing the psychokinetic  manifestations of Parmen's delirium.
Plato's  Stepchildren ,"22 Nov, 1968 ",67,How does one obtain the power?
Plato's  Stepchildren ,"22 Nov, 1968 ",67,"Captain, it will be very gratifying to leave here."
Plato's  Stepchildren ,"22 Nov, 1968 ",67,Even if he shouldn't.
Plato's  Stepchildren ,"22 Nov, 1968 ",67,"Doctor McCoy, you may yet cure the common cold."
Plato's  Stepchildren ,"22 Nov, 1968 ",67,Obviously Parmen does not wish any contact made with the  Enterprise.
Plato's  Stepchildren ,"22 Nov, 1968 ",67,To shut out any knowledge of his brutal treatment of a Starfleet  captain.
Plato's  Stepchildren ,"22 Nov, 1968 ",67,"Agreed, Captain. And Parmen wouldn't have treated you so  brutally if he had any intention of releasing you or the Enterprise."
Plato's  Stepchildren ,"22 Nov, 1968 ",67,"Whose harmony? Yours? Plato wanted truth and beauty, and above  all, justice."
Plato's  Stepchildren ,"22 Nov, 1968 ",67,Two spacemen marching to a drum.   KIRK +
Plato's  Stepchildren ,"22 Nov, 1968 ",67,"We slith among the mimsey toves, and gyre among the  borogoves."
Plato's  Stepchildren ,"22 Nov, 1968 ",67,"I trust they did not injure you too much, Captain."
Plato's  Stepchildren ,"22 Nov, 1968 ",67,The humiliation must have been most difficult for you to bear. I  can understand.
Plato's  Stepchildren ,"22 Nov, 1968 ",67,"That may be, Doctor. However, I have noted that the healthy  release of emotion is frequently very unhealthy for those closest to  you."
Plato's  Stepchildren ,"22 Nov, 1968 ",67,So it would seem. Captain.
Plato's  Stepchildren ,"22 Nov, 1968 ",67,Do you still feel anger toward Parmen?
Plato's  Stepchildren ,"22 Nov, 1968 ",67,"And you, Doctor?"
Plato's  Stepchildren ,"22 Nov, 1968 ",67,"Then you must release it, gentlemen, as I must master mine. I  might have seriously injured you, Captain, even killed you. They have  evoked such great hatred in me, I cannot allow it to go further. I must  master it. I must control."
Plato's  Stepchildren ,"22 Nov, 1968 ",67,"Alexander, it is possible for you to recall how long after you  arrived here that that power began to develop?"
Plato's  Stepchildren ,"22 Nov, 1968 ",67,And would you know how many months' supplies you brought with  you?
Plato's  Stepchildren ,"22 Nov, 1968 ",67,"That's close enough, Alexander. Fascinating. Their power  developed two or three months after they started eating the native  foods."
Plato's  Stepchildren ,"22 Nov, 1968 ",67,Then it is logical to assume that there is a connection between  the psychokinetic power and the eating of the native foods.
Plato's  Stepchildren ,"22 Nov, 1968 ",67,Perhaps his system cannot absorb the crucial element.
Plato's  Stepchildren ,"22 Nov, 1968 ",67,The probabilities are that Alexander was born with some  biochemical deficiency relative to Platonius.
Plato's  Stepchildren ,"22 Nov, 1968 ",67,The pituitary hormones confirm the hypothesis. They also  regulate body growth.
Plato's  Stepchildren ,"22 Nov, 1968 ",67,Yes. It's also obvious why Parmen kept this little utopia  secret. Anyone coming down here and remaining long enough would acquire  the power.
Plato's  Stepchildren ,"22 Nov, 1968 ",67,"The point is well taken. However, the psychokinetic power is not  additive. If it were, considering the Platonians' hostile propensities,  two or three of them would have combined forces centuries ago and  deposed Parmen."
Plato's  Stepchildren ,"22 Nov, 1968 ",67,The time factor concerns me. It may take days or even weeks  before there's enough build up from the kironide to be of any benefit  to us.
Plato's  Stepchildren ,"22 Nov, 1968 ",67,"I have experienced a slight flush, Captain."
Plato's  Stepchildren ,"22 Nov, 1968 ",67,"Take care, young ladies, and value your wine. Be  watchful of young men in their velvet prime.   Deeply they'll swallow from your finest kegs. Then swiftly be gone  leaving bitter dregs. Ah, bitter dregs.   With smiling words and tender touch. Man offers little and asks for so  much""   He loves in the breathless excitement of night, then leaves with your  treasure in cold morning light. Ah, in cold morning light"""
Plato's  Stepchildren ,"22 Nov, 1968 ",67,We have tried.
Plato's  Stepchildren ,"22 Nov, 1968 ",67,I haven't the power. I'm deeply sorry. We've failed you.
Plato's  Stepchildren ,"22 Nov, 1968 ",67,Quite possible and logical.
Plato's  Stepchildren ,"22 Nov, 1968 ",67,"That would be highly uncharacteristic. We must expect, Parmen,  that the moment we leave here, your fear would be gone and you would  again be as sadistic and as arrogant as your twenty five hundred years  have made you."
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,"Evidently a civilisation of high order, rating number seven on  the industrial scale. Humanoid in appearance, according to the  paintings. An abundance of literature, which I shall have translated  and processed. Certain structures hold evidence of recent occupancy  while others are apparently long abandoned."
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,"Instrument readings indicate life-form, but of a highly unusual  and intermittent nature. They have no discernible form or location. A  most puzzling phenomenon, Captain. I shall have to study it further."
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,"Unknown at present, Captain."
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,It is logical to assume that this distress call was  pre-recorded. What we received was evidently a delayed taped message.
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,It would seem that some force or agent only partially  discernible to our instruments may have been responsible.
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,I have a reading from Life Support centre. Alien substances  being introduced.
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,"It is a force field, Captain, the nature of which I'm not  familiar with. I'm getting readings of an alien presence similar to  those obtained on the planet's surface, but they seem to have no exact  location."
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,"It would seem, Captain, that they intend to allow only the two  of us to enter. I should advise caution."
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,"Unknown, Captain. But it is evidently a device of alien origin."
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,Life support is still operating. I would say that the  installation is incomplete.
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,"It seems that we may look at it, Captain, but that is all."
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,"Yes. Evidently they are convinced that we can do nothing to stop  them, and they wish to impress upon us what they can do to us."
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,Affirmative.
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,"Computer, analyse and reply. Have we been invaded?"
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,Nature and description of enemy forces.
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,Number of enemy forces.
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,Purpose of the invasion?
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,Is there a connection between this and Compton's disappearance?
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,Are we at present capable of resisting?
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,Your recommendation?
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,"Your recommendations, Captain?"
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,"Lieutenant, did you see what happened?"
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,"Mister Sulu, do you verify?"
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,"I'm getting a trace reading similar to that  on the planet. Mister Sulu, did you drink your coffee?"
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,Did anyone else?
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,May I?
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,I cannot give you that answer until these have been analysed.
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,"I suggest that we recall the captain's words, Make them take the  next step. It would seem they have taken it. And we must determine  effective countermeasures. Mister Scott, you have the conn. I shall be  in the medical lab."
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,"Nurse, programme the information and  determine whether we can find counteragents.  Doctor,  did you just"
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,"I know what it is. We brought it with us from Scalos. If you'll  excuse me, I shall be on the bridge."
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,"Lieutenant, will you replay the Scalosian  distress call on my viewer?"
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,"Lieutenant Uhura, notify the rest of the crew."
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,"Mister Scott, we cannot cope with them on our level."
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,That is a very logical suggestion. Stand by in the transporter  room.
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,"Yes, it counteracts the substance most effectively."
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,By drinking the Scalosian water.
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,"It is somewhat stimulating. You seem to be moving very slowly,  Doctor. Fascinating."
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,"If you will devote yourself exclusively to the concerns of  Scalos, madam, we shall be pleased to remain and take care of the  Enterprise."
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,"Doctor McCoy and I have synthesised a possible counteragent to  the Scalosian water. Regrettably, we did not have the opportunity to  test it."
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,"You do seem to be moving very slowly, Captain."
Wink  Of An Eye ,"29 Nov, 1968 ",68,"Thank you, Captain. I found it an accelerating experience."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"I suggest no supernatural explanation, Captain. I merely point  out that the facts do not fit any known categories of planets."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,Undoubtedly. The age of this planet would seem to be only a few  thousand years. It would be impossible for vegetation to evolve in so  short a period.
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,But its mass and atmosphere are similar to Earth.
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"It would be impossible, Captain. An atmosphere could not evolve  in so short a period of time."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,Evidently. But the inconsistencies are so compounded as to  present a seemingly impossible phenomenon.
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"Precisely, Captain."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"Lieutenant Rahda, report to the bridge immediately."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,Yes. I believe no permanent damage was done.
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,The occipital area of my head seems to have impacted with the  chair.
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,That we have yet to ascertain.
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"Dead? Spock to Sickbay.   M'BENGA : Sickbay, Doctor M'Benga."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,Report on the death of the transporter officer.    M'BENGA: We're not sure. Doctor Sanchez is  conducting an autopsy right now.
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"Give me a full report as soon as possible,  please. Spock out. Mister Scott, have the transporter checked for  possible malfunction."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,The stars.
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,Wrong?
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,A positional change.
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"Nine hundred and ninety point seven light years to be exact,  Lieutenant."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"Mister Scott, since we are here, your statement is not only  illogical but also unworthy of refutation. It is also illogical to  assume that any explosion, even that of a small star going supernova,  could have hurled us a distance of nine hundred and ninety point seven  light years."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"That is correct, Mister Scott, by all the laws that we know.  There was no period of unconsciousness. Our ship's chronometers  registered a matter of only a few seconds. Therefore, we were displaced  through space in some manner which I am unable to fathom."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"Please, Mister Scott, restrain your leaps of illogic. I have  said nothing. I was merely speculating.   M'BENGA : Sickbay to Mister Spock."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"Spock here.    M'BENGA: You asked for an autopsy report. It's only  preliminary, but the cause of death seems to have been cellular  disruption."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,Explain.    M'BENGA: It's as though every cell in the body had  been individually blasted from inside.
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"Would any known disease organism do that?    M'BENGA: Doctor Sanchez has ruled that possibility  out, sir."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"Please keep me fully advised. Spock out. He  was in the transporter room. Someone may have entered after Captain  Kirk and his party left. Mister Scott, since the Enterprise is  obviously functional, I suggest we return to our starting place at top  warp speed."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"In that case, Mister Scott, I suggest we start at once. Can you  give me warp eight?"
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"That position, Mister Scott, would not only be unavailing but  also undignified. Lieutenant Rahda, plot a course."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,Good. Then prepare to come to warp eight.
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"Eleven point three three seven hours, Lieutenant. I wish you  would be more precise."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,Spock here.
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"Feels, Mister Scott?"
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"That is obvious, Mister Scott. I suggest you avoid emotionalism  and simply keep your instruments correct."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,Spock here.
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"Do you know what he died of, Mister Scott?"
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"Security alert, all decks. Female intruder, extremely dangerous.  Security alert. All decks."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"Spock to Sickbay. Have you completed the  autopsy on Watkins, Doctor?   M'BENGA : Yes, we have, Mister Spock."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"Was the cause of his death the same as that which killed the  transporter officer?    M'BENGA: Well, the pattern of cellular disruption  was the same, but as to the cause, well your guess is as good as mine."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"My guess, Doctor, would be valueless. I  suggest we refrain from guessing and find some facts."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"The power of this intruder to disrupt every  cell in a body, combined with the almost inconceivable power required  to hurl the Enterprise such a distance, speak of a very high culture  and a very great danger."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"A reasonable assumption, Mister Scott."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"If there are more of those beings on that planet, the captain  and the others are in very great danger."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,Very well. Cancel Red Alert but maintain increased security.
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"Please update our subspace report to Starfleet to include  security search, results negative."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,Presumably the same way she got on.
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"Lieutenant, we are not engaged in gambling. We are proceeding in  the only logical way to return to the place they were last seen, and  factually ascertain whether or not they still live."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,Very well. Reduce speed to warp seven.
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,Bridge to Engineering. Negative effect on power reduction. Speed  is still increasing.
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"I would calculate fourteen point eight seven  minutes, Mister Scott."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,Sabotage.
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,You said it was fused. How?
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"Worries, Mister Scott?"
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,Interesting.
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"No, but the method is fascinating."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,A force that could hurl us nine hundred and ninety point seven  light years away and at that distance still be able to sabotage our  main source of energy  will not be waiting around to be taken into custody.
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"As I recall the pattern of our fuel flow, there is an access  tube leading to the matter-antimatter reaction chamber."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"Still, it is there, and it might be possible to shut off the  fuel at that point."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,A magnetic probe.
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,I shall try.
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"Unless a solution is found quickly, that fate awaits all of us."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"Very well, Mister Scott. You spoke of the feel of the ship being  wrong."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"I note it, Mister Scott, without necessarily understanding it. I  propose to run an analysis through the ship's computers,  comparing the present condition of the Enterprise with her ideal  condition."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"We have twelve minutes and twenty seven seconds. I suggest you  do whatever you can in the service crawlway, while I make the computer  study."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"Mister Scott, I suggest you refrain from any  further subjective descriptions. You now have ten minutes and nineteen  seconds in which to perform your task."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,You now have ten minutes and ten seconds.
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,I'm aware of these facts. Please get on with the job. Computer.
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,Analysis on my comparison co-ordinates.
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"Lieutenant Uhura, you are monitoring the  magnetic force?"
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"Please do not take your eyes off of it. Lieutenant Rahda, arm  the pod jettison system."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,Not until my order.
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"Mister Scott, what is your situation?"
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"You have eight minutes, forty one seconds."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,Computer read-out.
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,Continue.
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,Understood.
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,Spock here.
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"Mister Scott, ease off."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"Computer, for outphase condition, will reverse field achieve  closure?"
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,Mister Scott
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,Please commence. I'll explain.
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"Please continue, Mister Scott."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,Please continue.
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"Mister Scott, you have accomplished your task."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"For what purpose, Mister Scott?"
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,Feel that something else is necessary.
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,I had the same misgivings about you. We returned and picked up  your life form readings only a moment ago.
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,From where this brain had the power to send the Enterprise. Nine  hundred and ninety point seven light years across the galaxy. What a  remarkable culture this is.
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"I surmised that, Captain. Its moves were immensely logical. But  what people created this? Are there any representatives here?"
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"That is a loss, Captain."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"To do the job of defence, the computer projected a replica of  the only image available. Losira's."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"Beauty is transitory, Doctor. However, she was evidently highly  intelligent."
That  Which Survives ,"24 Jan, 1969 ",69,"Indeed, Captain?"
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,"That is exactly what it is, Mister Chekov."
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,"Captain, there is one living creature aboard. Humanoid. He is  either injured or ill. His craft shows internal atmospheric leakage.  The creature may be suffocating."
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,"You are certain, Doctor, that this pigmentation is the natural  condition of this individual?"
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,"Negative, Captain."
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,"There is no theory, Captain, from the basic work of Mendel to  recent nucleotide studies, which would explain our captive. All  gradations of colour from black to brown, to yellow to white are  genetically predictable. We must therefore conclude that this alien is  that often unaccountable rarity, a mutation, one of a kind."
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,Yet you are pumping him full of your noxious potions as if he  were a human.
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,"With your permission, Captain, I shall do some further research  and join you on the bridge.   )Spock leaves.)"
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,"Negative, Captain."
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,"There is a vessel out there, Captain."
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,"Negative. This would not be a Romulan vessel. It is totally  alien in configuration. Motive power unknown. Small size of the craft  indicates a rapid scout vessel, one or two-man crew."
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,Nothing identifiable. The craft appears to be built for speed  rather than combat.
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,"None. Completely elusive. In fact, it's invisible."
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,There is no sensor failure. The readings persist.
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,It just disintegrated. Fascinating.
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,"It is gone now, Captain, but it seems to have deposited an alien  presence."
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,A most unique craft. Pity it couldn't be salvaged for our study.
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,"Elusive, Captain. I am investigating."
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,"Confirmed, Captain. Holding pattern. Co-ordinates now indicate  we are charting course to  Captain, Cheron lies between four oh  three mark seven and mark nine."
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,"Captain, course is now clearly straight for Cheron, despite all  efforts to direct us to Ariannus."
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,"This is Commander Spock, science officer. Destruct sequence  number two, code one, one A, two B."
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,"Negative, Captain. We are still headed directly for Cheron."
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,"Negative, Captain. The Enterprise is now moving in a circular  course."
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,"Enterprise is now on course to Ariannus, Captain."
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,Fascinating. Two irrevocably hostile humanoids.
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,That description is not scientifically accurate.
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,"Commissioner, Starfleet Command may not arrive at the solution  you anticipate. There is the matter of the shuttlecraft which Lokai  appropriated. The interrogation of that matter may be of paramount  importance to Starfleet."
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,We do not know that Lokai has done that.
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,"The obvious visual evidence, Commissioner, is that he is of the  same breed as yourself."
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,"Commissioner, perhaps the experience of my own planet Vulcan may  set an example of some value to you. Vulcan was in danger of being  destroyed by the same conditions and characteristics which threaten to  destroy Cheron. We were once a people like yourselves, wildly  emotional, often committed to irrationally opposing points of view,  leading, of course, to death and destruction. Only the discipline of  logic saved my planet from extinction."
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,"Change is the essential process of all existence. For instance,  the people of Cheron must have once been mono-coloured."
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,The actual theory is that all life-forms evolved from the lower  levels to the more advanced stages.
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,"Trouble, Mister Chekov?"
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,"Captain, some of the memory banks of the computer are burned  out."
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,I doubt that the same can be said for many of his followers.
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,"Captain, we are within scanning range of Cheron."
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,"Coming within visual range now, Captain."
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,"Several large cities, uninhabited. Extensive traffic systems,  barren of traffic. Lower animal sand vegetation encroaching on the  cities. No sapient life-forms registering at all, Captain. There is no  evidence of natural disaster, yet there are vast numbers of unburied  corpses in all cities."
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,"All dead, Captain. They have annihilated each other totally."
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,"None at all, sir."
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,Where can he go?
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,"Captain, I have located them on ship's sensors. Bele is chasing  Lokai on deck three. Bele is passing recreation room three, approaching  the crewmen's lounge. Lokai is running past the crewmen's lounge. Lokai  has just arrived on deck five. Passing recreation room three."
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,"Negative, Captain. Transporter room is clear. However, there is  a life-form materialising on the planet. It is Lokai. He is back on  Cheron."
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,"It is Bele, Captain. And another life-form has appeared on  Cheron."
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,To expect sense from two mentalities of such extreme viewpoints  is not logical.
Let  That Be Your Last Battlefield ,"10 Jan, 1969 ",70,Not to Lokai and Bele. All that matters to them is their hate.
Whom  Gods Destroy ,"3 Jan, 1969 ",71,Governor.
Whom  Gods Destroy ,"3 Jan, 1969 ",71,"Governor, you indicated one additional inmate since our last  visit, making a total of fifteen. Is that correct?"
Whom  Gods Destroy ,"3 Jan, 1969 ",71,A total of fifteen incurably insane out of billions is not what  I would call an excessive figure. Who is the new inmate?
Whom  Gods Destroy ,"3 Jan, 1969 ",71,"She sounds rational enough, Captain."
Whom  Gods Destroy ,"3 Jan, 1969 ",71,"Very well indeed, thank you, Captain."
Whom  Gods Destroy ,"3 Jan, 1969 ",71,"If you could create a diversion, I might be able to  find the control room and open the force field."
Whom  Gods Destroy ,"3 Jan, 1969 ",71,"I find it mildly interesting and somewhat nostalgic, if I  understand the use of that word."
Whom  Gods Destroy ,"3 Jan, 1969 ",71,"Yes. It is somewhat reminiscent of the dances that Vulcan  children do in nursery school. Of course, the children are not so well  co-ordinated."
Whom  Gods Destroy ,"3 Jan, 1969 ",71,"On what, precisely, is our friendship to be based?"
Whom  Gods Destroy ,"3 Jan, 1969 ",71,Why?
Whom  Gods Destroy ,"3 Jan, 1969 ",71,"How could you, a Starship fleet Captain, believe that a  Federation crew would blindly obey your order to destroy the entire  Antos race, a people famous for their benevolence and peaceful  pursuits?"
Whom  Gods Destroy ,"3 Jan, 1969 ",71,"Captain Kirk speaks somewhat figuratively and with undue  emotion. However, what he says is logical and I do, in fact, agree with  it."
Whom  Gods Destroy ,"3 Jan, 1969 ",71,"Please forgive me, but exactly where is your fleet?"
Whom  Gods Destroy ,"3 Jan, 1969 ",71,Captain Garth
Whom  Gods Destroy ,"3 Jan, 1969 ",71,"As you wish. At any rate, you must be aware of the fact that you  are attempting to recreate the disaster which resulted in your becoming  an inmate in this place."
Whom  Gods Destroy ,"3 Jan, 1969 ",71,"On the contrary. You were treated with justice, and with  compassion which you failed to show towards any of your intended  victims. Logically, therefore, one must assume"
Whom  Gods Destroy ,"3 Jan, 1969 ",71,She seems to have worked out an infallible method for assuring  permanent male fidelity. Interesting.
Whom  Gods Destroy ,"3 Jan, 1969 ",71,"Thank you, Captain.  We're now armed. I presume  we shall try to reach the control room."
Whom  Gods Destroy ,"3 Jan, 1969 ",71,"Force field is now off, Captain."
Whom  Gods Destroy ,"3 Jan, 1969 ",71,"Captain, I suggest you return to the ship at once. Your safety  is vital to the Enterprise."
Whom  Gods Destroy ,"3 Jan, 1969 ",71,I also request permission to remain here in charge of the  security team when they beam down.
Whom  Gods Destroy ,"3 Jan, 1969 ",71,"Mister Scott, the Captain's life is in immediate danger. Beam  him aboard at once. The security team will be entrusted to me."
Whom  Gods Destroy ,"3 Jan, 1969 ",71,"He's waiting for the proper reply, Captain."
Whom  Gods Destroy ,"3 Jan, 1969 ",71,"Give him the countersign, Captain."
Whom  Gods Destroy ,"3 Jan, 1969 ",71,Queen to queen's level three.   KIRK
Whom  Gods Destroy ,"3 Jan, 1969 ",71,Arranging to beam down a security team. Are there any  objections?   KIRK
Whom  Gods Destroy ,"3 Jan, 1969 ",71,Fascinating. What maneuver did we use to defeat the Romulan  vessel near Tau Ceti?   KIRK
Whom  Gods Destroy ,"3 Jan, 1969 ",71,"Agreed, Captain. Captains. Gentlemen, whichever one of you is  Captain Garth must at this moment be expending a great deal of energy  to maintain the image of Captain Kirk. That energy level cannot be  maintained indefinitely, and I have time."
Whom  Gods Destroy ,"3 Jan, 1969 ",71,"Captain Kirk, I presume."
Whom  Gods Destroy ,"3 Jan, 1969 ",71,Spock to Enterprise.
Whom  Gods Destroy ,"3 Jan, 1969 ",71,Queen to king's level one.
Whom  Gods Destroy ,"3 Jan, 1969 ",71,"I am Mister Spock, science officer on a Starship."
Whom  Gods Destroy ,"3 Jan, 1969 ",71,"Yes, Captain."
Whom  Gods Destroy ,"3 Jan, 1969 ",71,"It was not impossible, Captain. Our presence here is proof of  that."
Whom  Gods Destroy ,"3 Jan, 1969 ",71,"The interval of uncertainty was actually fairly brief, Captain.  It only seemed long to you. I was waiting for a victor in the hand to  hand struggle, which I assumed would be Captain Garth. Because of your  depleted condition. Failing a resolution to the struggle, I was forced  to use other means to make my determination."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"I shall be interested in hearing your description, Captain."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,Lieutenant Uhura.
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,Do we have final clearance from Gideon?
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"May I have them, please?"
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,Eight seven five.
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,Zero two zero.
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,Zero seven nine.
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,Energising.
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,Put it on the screen.
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"This is Mister Spock, Ambassador Hodin. Captain Kirk was  transported down minutes ago."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,I transported him myself.
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,He was beamed directly to your council chambers. Please verify  your co-ordinates.
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"I am not questioning that, sir."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"I do not deny that, sir. I am not attempting  to blame your personnel."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"Your Excellency, even with intricate machinery as delicately  balanced as ours, there is still a margin for error which must be dealt  with."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,Your Excellency. May I cut right to the heart of the matter? I  request permission to beam down to conduct a search for our captain.
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"Your Excellency, the wars between opposing star systems no  longer prevail in our galaxy. If you will grant permission"
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,We must acknowledge once and for all that the purpose of  diplomacy is to prolong a crisis.
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"We are representatives of the Federation, Doctor."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"Unfortunately, diplomacy is the only channel available to us at  the moment. The planet is shielded from our sensors, therefore we  cannot scan it. Therefore we are unable to select co-ordinates. They  must be provided by Gideon."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"We did not, Mister Chekov. The Federation did. Lieutenant Uhura."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,Contact Starfleet immediately. Explain our problem. Request  permission to use every means at our disposal to press the search for  Captain Kirk.
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"There are endless, Mister Chekov."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"Institute a sensor scan three hundred and sixty degrees, one  degree at a time."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"Then the sooner you begin, the better."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"Lieutenant Uhura, has Starfleet honoured our  request with a reply?"
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,Did you advise them the captain's life is at stake?
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,What department?
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,Contact them directly.
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"Diplomats and bureaucrats may function differently, but they  achieve exactly the same results."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"True, Your Excellency."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"Your Excellency, I am basically a scientist.  Clarity of formulation is essential in my profession also."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"Yes, Your Excellency."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"Yes, Your Excellency."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"I apologise for the noise, your Excellency. To summarise, I  request permission to transport down to Gideon."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"Mister Scott, you'll go to the transporter room and await my  orders."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"Yes, Your Excellency. The ship's engineer  was explaining that the malfunction, which did exist, has now been  repaired. We would appreciate an opportunity to test the equipment. I,  therefore, request permission"
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"Your Excellency, grant this one request."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"Thank you, Your Excellency. Your proposal is  accepted. Mister Scott."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,Prepare to beam aboard a representative of the Gideon council.
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"Your Excellency, your assistant has arrived  safely, and I am now ready to transport down to Gideon."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"Sir, our captain is still missing, and I now demand that I be  allowed to transport to Gideon as we agreed."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"Mister Scott, beam down the gentleman from Gideon."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"Do not give up hope. Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starfleet  Command. Demand an immediate reply to our request for permission to  beam down to Gideon."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"Admiral, the crew will not understand it."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,We wish only to save the life of the captain.
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"I am positive that I can do so to your satisfaction, Admiral. I  have been convinced, since my first exchange with the ambassador, that  the captain has been taken prisoner."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"I now know where the captain is being held, if he is being held  at the same place to which we transported him."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"Sir, the captain is not being held in the Gideon council  chamber. He is being held nearby."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"Since the planet is shielded from our sensors, we cannot  establish that without on the spot investigation."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"Admiral, I wish to state for the record that your decision is  completely arbitrary."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"They did not ask for our understanding, Doctor."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"Unfortunately, I must violate a direct order from Starfleet."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"I do not make it lightly, Doctor. However, Command knows that  Ambassador Hodin has not been totally honest with us. Lieutenant Uhura,  repeat original Gideon co-ordinates for beam down."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"Mister Scott, the co-ordinates given you?"
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"Precisely. I shall beam down at once. Mister Scott, you have the  conn."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"Negative, Doctor. I cannot accept the responsibility for  ordering a fellow officer to violate a Starfleet directive. I can make  such a decision only for myself."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"The situation forces me to do so, Doctor."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,This will not take long.
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,Captain Kirk. Spock here.  Captain Kirk?
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,An exact duplicate of the Enterprise. But  completely inoperative.  Spock to Enterprise. Spock  to Enterprise.
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,I am speaking to you from the bridge of the Enterprise.
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,And they were correct. I'm on board an exact  duplicate of the Enterprise.
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"In orbit, Doctor. In a manner of speaking,  Gideon is in orbit and the ship is on Gideon."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"I'm sure he's on board somewhere. I'm  picking up life readings. Spock out.   Ship's log, stardate 5423.8. First Officer Spock  reporting. Obviously the Gideon's have transported Captain Kirk onto  this replica of the Enterprise to so confuse his mind as to make him  susceptible to some extraordinary experiment. It is my intention to  locate the captain and warn him before the experiment reaches its  conclusion, which logic indicates means the end of the captain's life  as he knows it."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"Your Excellency. Captain, you're looking well. Evidently  Starfleet's analysis was correct."
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,Spock to Enterprise. Spock to Enterprise.
The  Mark Of Gideon ,"17 Jan, 1969 ",72,"Negative. Lock in on my communicator signal. Your Excellency,  please do not interfere. I already have one serious problem to resolve  with upper echelons."
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,"Indications are a storm, Captain, although I've never seen one  of such great intensity or strange confirmation."
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,All sensor readings are at maximum calibration.
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,"It is definitely doing so, Captain. Therefore it cannot be a  phenomenon of nature."
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,Some equipment was temporarily out of order. My sensors were  inoperative.
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,"None, Captain."
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,"Captain, it was not a storm."
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,"Only of the result, not of the cause. In each case, a different  area of the brain was affected. Our voluntary nerve functions were  under some form of pressure."
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,"Attack might be a more precise formulation, Captain."
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,"It is of little consequence, Captain. Memory Alpha has no  protective shields."
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,"None, Captain. When the library complex was assembled, shielding  was considered inappropriate to its totally academic purpose. Since the  information on the Memory planet is available to everyone, special  protection was deemed unnecessary."
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,"It varies with the number of scholars, researchers, and  scientists from the various Federation planets who are using the  computer complex."
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,"Sensors give no readings of generated energy from Memory Alpha,  Captain."
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,None.
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,"A disaster for the galaxy, Captain. The central brain is  damaged. The memory core is burned out. The loss to the galaxy may be  irretrievable."
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,"A very faint life reading in the immediate vicinity, Captain."
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,Negative.
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,The attack was thorough.
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,"Lieutenant, I assure you that unexplained phenomenon was headed  away from the planet. It is probably seeking other victims."
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,No known conditions in space would support that type of natural  phenomenon.
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,I'm having difficulty with the ship's sensors. They seem to be  under selective attack by the phenomenon as the unfortunate occupants  of Memory Alpha were.
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,Ship's sensors are operating at the moment. Perhaps the elusive  creature will now reveal something about itself.
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,"Negative, Captain. Maintaining its distance. However, it is  matching each manoeuvre we execute, and I am receiving increasing  magnitude of energy."
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,"Not what is it, Captain. What are they? There are ten distinct  life units within it, all powerfully alive and vital."
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,Impossible to determine without programming for computer  analysis.
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,I do not believe the Enterprise shields would prove an effective  defence.
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,"Captain, we are dealing with a community of life units. Their  attack is in the form of brain waves directed against the brain, which  is most compatible."
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,Perhaps it did not understand.
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,It appears so.
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,Not directly.
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,"Negative, Captain. I have not been able to gather sufficient  data for that. Captain, there is only one possible defence. If we can  find an environment which is deadly to the alien form."
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,"I am, Captain. I have fed all obtainable data to the main  computer. It should be ready to supply whatever conclusions are  possible."
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,"Doctor McCoy, according to your records, Lieutenant Romaine  showed no abnormal telepathic powers."
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,And you are sure that this is the correct slide?
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,"Gentlemen, it also happens to be tape H, the impulse tracking  obtained from the alien life units."
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,"As I said, Captain, this is the tracking obtained during the  last shielded run. Computer, run a detailed comparison brain circuitry  patterns, tape D and tape H."
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,Fascinating.
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,"Doctor McCoy is correct, Captain. There is an identity of minds  taking place  between the alien beings and the mind of Lieutenant Romaine. Their  thoughts are becoming hers."
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,"At their present force, they will get through the shields this  time, Captain."
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,"She will, unless we are able to complete what the captain has  planned."
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,"Captain, we must deal with them directly, now, while she still  retains partial identity. We can speak to them. They will answer using  her voice."
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,That is one of the planets where all humanoid life was  destroyed.
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,They will not accept their own deaths.
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,"Captain, if we cannot complete the plan, they will carry out  their threat."
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,The weightless state has become their natural condition.
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,"We may tax Mister Scott's patience, Doctor."
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,"Particularly where humans are involved, Doctor."
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,"Doctor McCoy is correct, Captain. While the truth was difficult  to accept, when it was revealed, the girl reacted well. I would say her  struggle in this experience would strengthen her entire ego structure."
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,"You mean, love as motivation? Humans do claim a great deal for  that particular emotion. I suppose it is possible. However"
The  Lights Of Zetar ,"31 Jan, 1969 ",73,Logical.
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,"It is, Captain."
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,"They've already been provided to the transport officer, Captain.  Along with those of the council chamber of the High Advisor."
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,"Stratos, Captain. A city actually floating in the sky."
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,"It is one of the most interesting metropolises in the galaxy.  Have you ever visited here, Captain?"
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,"I've never had the opportunity. However, I hear its art forms  are incomparable."
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,It is a totally intellectual society. All forms of violence have  been eliminated.
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,"Perhaps there is another entrance, Captain."
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,It would seem the Troglytes have changed their minds about  delivery.
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,"Greetings, Mister Advisor."
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,The Disrupters? Who are they?
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,Remarkable. The finest example of sustained antigravity  elevation I've ever seen.
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,"Nor I a work of art, madam."
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,Despoil? For what purpose?
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,"Mister Advisor, the plant life is the source of oxygen on that  planet. Obviously, if all plant life is destroyed, the humanoid life  will follow."
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,But why do they destroy art forms? That is a loss to everyone.
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,"That would be most welcome, Mister Advisor."
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,Your movements awakened me.
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,Only Vulcan ears would find the noise discernible.
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,The same may be said of Stratos inhabitants.
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,We do pride ourselves on our logic.
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,"The seven-year cycle is biologically inherent in all Vulcan's.  At that time, the mating drive outweighs all other motivations."
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,"Extreme feminine beauty is always disturbing, madam."
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,"Am I intruding, Captain?"
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,"In other words, they perform all the physical toil necessary to  maintain Stratos."
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,But they are not allowed to share its advantages.
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,The surface of the planet is almost unendurable. To restrict a  segment of the population to such hardship is unthinkable in an evolved  culture.
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,Troglyte is an abbreviation of an ancient Earth term. Its  technical translation is cave dweller.
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,"Violence in reality is quite different from theory, is it not,  madam?"
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,"All the little things you and I understand and expect from life,  such as equality, kindness, justice."
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,But they're all the same species. Those who live on Stratos and  those who live below all originated on the planet. Their physical and  mental evolution must be similar. That is basic biological law.
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,Incredible. Zenite is shipped all over the galaxy wherever there  is danger of plant bacteria. No side effects have ever been reported.
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,"As part of the staff of Stratos, Vanna was removed from exposure  for a long period. It is likely that without such exposure, the effect  slowly wears off."
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,"Unequal evolution did not begin until after your ancestors  removed themselves from constant exposure to the gas, Mister Advisor."
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,Nor much time. We have ten hours and forty minutes to deliver  that consignment to Merak Two.
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,"Captain, if you are apprehended deliberately violating the High  Advisor's orders, he will be within his rights to have you executed, if  he chooses."
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,Allow me to point out that a first officer is more expendable  than either a doctor or a captain.
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,Locked in and ready to beam up consignment.
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,Standing by for instructions.
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,Instructions clear. I shall carry them out  immediately. Spock out.
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,"That's not an exact quote, Mister Scott. However, it does  express the thought."
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,You will have that opportunity.
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,"Now that is an exact quote, Mister Scott, and I suggest you  handle the transporter yourself. This could be very delicate as a  problem in transporting for us and in diplomacy for the captain."
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,Spock here.
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,You'll have to delay.
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,Picking up two life-forms in the gallery.
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,Without the other.
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,"Precisely, Mister Scott."
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,"Until the High Advisor is alone or can be isolated, the captain  will have to wait. Unless you have an alternative?"
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,Spock to transporter room.
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,Lock in on Council Gallery co-ordinates.
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,Energise.
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,"How are you doing, Mister Scott?"
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,Beam him down to Captain Kirk immediately.
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,"Good work, Mister Scott."
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,The captain will employ his usual diplomatic balm.
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,"Contact check, Captain. It has been over an  hour since your last communication."
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,"Standing by, Captain."
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,That is very unlike the captain.
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,"Enterprise, Spock here."
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,"Captain, the zenite gas has affected you. Captain! The zenite  gas!"
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,"It is less technical, therefore less accurate, but perhaps more  generally descriptive of the function."
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,"There is great beauty in the knowledge that lies below, and only  one way to really experience it."
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,"No. No, Vulcan is quite different."
The  Cloud Minders ,"28 Feb, 1969 ",74,"Two hours, fifty-nine minutes to be exact, Captain."
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,"It is definitely the stolen space cruiser, Captain, the Aurora.  I read six aboard."
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,I read no evidence of malfunction.
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,"Their engines are seriously overheating, Captain."
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,Power approaching critical. They cannot continue.
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,Power beyond critical. Explosion is  imminent.
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,"Captain, with your permission"
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,One.
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,One is the beginning.
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,I am not Herbert.
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,"If you will state your purpose and your objectives, perhaps we  can arrive at a mutual understanding."
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,I would prefer that you state it.
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,What is your destination?
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,"Yes, Captain."
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,"Yes, Captain."
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,"Many myths are based on truth, Captain, and they are not  unintelligent. Their leader, Doctor Sevrin, is a man"
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,"Yes. A brilliant research engineer in the fields of acoustics,  communications and electronics on Tiburon. He was dismissed from his  post when he started this movement. Tong Rad inherits his father's  extraordinary abilities in the field of space studies."
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,"There are many who are uncomfortable with what we have created.  It is almost a biological rebellion. A profound revulsion against the  planned communities, the programming, the sterilised, artfully balanced  atmospheres. They hunger for an Eden where spring comes."
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,"Yes, that is true, Captain."
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,"It is not sympathy so much as curiosity, Captain. A wish to  understand. They regard themselves as aliens in their own worlds, a  condition with which I am somewhat familiar."
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,"It is somewhat uncomplimentary, Captain. Herbert was a minor  official notorious for his rigid and limited patterns of thought."
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,"I shall make an attempt, Captain."
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,"Yes, sir.   Captain's log, stardate 5832.5. The arrogance of  Doctor Sevrin and his followers is creating an intolerable situation  aboard the Enterprise. If it continues, I'll be forced to use controls  which might not agree with Starfleet's suggestion that they be handled  with extreme tolerance."
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,"They respect you. They will listen to your reasoning. For their  sake, you must stop them. Doctor Sevrin, I'm in a position to help you  and your group. I can use the resources of the Enterprise to determine  whether or not Eden actually exists and to plot its exact location. I  can present a case to Federation to allow you and your group to  colonise that planet. Neither you nor your people are at present  charged with a crime. However, incitement to disaffection is criminal.  The Federation will never allow the colonisation of a planet by  criminals. If they persist, they will be so charged and forever barred  from Eden."
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,Then you knew you were a carrier.
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,What I fail to understand is why you disobey those orders.
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,Your very presence will destroy the people you seek. Surely you  know that.
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,"Yes, Doctor."
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,"Yes, Doctor."
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,"Doctor Sevrin is insane. I've not consulted  Doctor McCoy, but I have no doubt of it."
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,"His condition does not affect my interest in the movement. There  is no insanity in what they seek. I made a promise which I should like  to keep. With your permission, I must locate Eden. I shall work in my  quarters. May I have the assistance of Mister Chekov in auxiliary  control?"
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,Come in.
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,No.
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,"If I understand you correctly, I believe the answer might be  yes."
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,"He has the capability, Captain."
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,Negative.
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,"Adam, there is a file on Doctor Sevrin in our computer banks. In  it you'll find a report attesting to the fact"
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,That he is a carrier of a bacillus strain  known as Synthococcus novae.
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,"You'll also find a report from the same  hospital, giving a full psychological profile on him and projecting  these actions of his."
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,Adam. You know I reach you. I believe in  what you seek. But there is a tragic difference between what you want  and what he wants.
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,We are within sensor range of Eden and  continuing to approach.
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,"No, Captain, it hasn't stopped. It has gone beyond"
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,"Captain, they're using"
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,"Captain, go. I. You must destroy the"
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,Ultrasonics. The panel.
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,"Negative, Captain. However I am picking up the shuttlecraft."
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,"It has landed. Except for those aboard the craft, I read no life  at all, either humanoid nor animal."
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,"The legends were true, Captain. Fantastically beautiful planet."
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,Captain.
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,His name was Adam.
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,Spock to Enterprise.
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,Stand by to beam aboard injured parties. Medical team to the  transporter room.
The  Way To Eden ,"21 Feb, 1969 ",75,"Miss Galliulin. It is my sincere wish that you do not give up  your search for Eden. I have no doubt but that you will find it, or  make it yourselves."
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,"Strange. Readings indicate a life form in the vicinity,  apparently human. Yet ship's sensors indicated this planet was  uninhabited."
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,"Did you say your planet, sir?"
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,"Mister Flint, unless you are certain, I would suggest you  refrain from a most useless experiment."
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,"Are you a student of history, sir?"
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,Then you live here alone.
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,It would seem logical to do so for the moment.
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,"This is the most splendid private collection of art I've ever  seen, and the most unique. The majority are the works of Leonardo da  Vinci, Renaissance period, some of the works of Reginald Pollack, 20th  century, and even a sten from Marcus Two."
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,"Thank you, Doctor. I will have a brandy."
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,"If I appear distracted, it is because of what I have seen. I am  close to experiencing an unaccustomed emotion."
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,"Envy. None of these da Vinci paintings has ever been catalogued  or reproduced. They are unknown works, all apparently authentic to the  last brush stroke and use of materials. As undiscovered da Vinci's,  they would be priceless."
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,Most strange. A man of Flint's obvious wealth and impeccable  taste scarcely needs to hang fakes. Yet my tricorder analysis indicates  that the canvas and pigments used are of contemporary origin.
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,Indeed. I would appreciate such a talk. It is an interest of  mine.
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,Irillium will render the antitoxin inert and useless.
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,Captain. Something else which is rather extraordinary. This  waltz I just played is by Johannes Brahms.
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,"Captain, it is written in manuscript. In original manuscript, in  Brahms' own hand, which I recognise. It is totally unknown, definitely  the work of Brahms, and yet unknown."
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,"Fortunately, the robot did not detect my presence and deactivate  my phaser."
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,Fascinating.
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,"Since we are dependent on Mister Flint for the ryetalyn,  Captain, may I respectfully suggest that you pay less attention to the  young lady if you should encounter her again. Our host's interests do  not appear to be confined to art and science."
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,Strongly indicated.
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,It does appear to defy the male logic as I understand it.
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,"We have still a greater mystery, Captain. I was able to run a  tricorder scan on Mister Flint. He is human, but there are certain  biophysical peculiarities. Some body function readings are  disproportionate. For one thing, extreme age is indicated on the order  of six thousand years."
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,I shall programme the readings through Doctor McCoy's medical  computer when we return to the ship.
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,We must commence ryetalyn injections within two hours and  eighteen minutes or the epidemic will prove fatal to us all.
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,"Captain, I would suggest that our immediate concern is the  ryetalyn."
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,"Interesting. Obviously, Mister Flint is not yet ready for us to  depart."
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,The captain wanted us to wait here.
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,"Picking up tricorder readings, Captain. Apparently the ryetalyn  is behind this door."
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,"Captain, I shall get the ryetalyn."
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,There may be dangers within.
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,"Let me go alone, Captain."
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,"Your collection of Leonardo da Vinci masterpieces, Mister Flint,  they appear to have been recently painted  on contemporary canvas with contemporary materials. And on your piano,  a waltz by Johannes Brahms, an unknown work in manuscript, written in  modern ink. Yet absolutely authentic, as are your paintings."
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,And da Vinci?
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,How many other names shall we call you?
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,You were born?
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,Your wealth and your intellect are the product of centuries of  acquisition. You knew the greatest minds in history.
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,"You wanted a perfect, ultimate woman, as brilliant, as immortal  as yourself. Your mate for all time."
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,I had hoped I was wrong.
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,"We have discovered what he is, Captain."
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,We can remain silent.
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,What will you feel for him after we are gone?
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,"Captain, your primitive impulses will not alter the  circumstances."
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,"No, you're not, for she is not."
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,"Gentlemen, I urge you to stop. There is a danger."
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,"She loved you, Captain. And you, too, Mister Flint, as a mentor,  even as a father. There was not enough time for her to adjust to the  awful power and contradictions of her new-found emotions. She could not  bear to hurt either of you.  The joys of love made her human, and the agonies of love destroyed her."
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,"The epidemic is reduced and no longer a threat. The Enterprise  is on course five one three mark seven, as you ordered."
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,"Your report, Doctor."
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,"On that day, I shall mourn. Does he know?"
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,Indeed.
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,"Goodnight, Doctor."
Requiem  For Methuselah ,"14 Feb, 1969 ",76,Forget.
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,"I still read a suggestion of carbon cycle life forms on the  planet surface, Captain."
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,"Agreed. Mister Sulu, switch to the planet area I have under  observation."
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,Which would indicate a considerable civilisation there.
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,"Our readings could be false, Captain, perhaps caused by some  natural phenomena."
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,"We're being scanned, Captain. A deep probe, incredibly swift."
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,Fascinating.
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,"They did scan us and our vessel, Captain, and doubtless obtained  sufficient information to present this illusion."
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,"Small change occurring there, Captain."
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,An area of approximately one thousand square kilometres. It  measures completely Earth-like.
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,"Fascinating. For a moment, it appeared almost mineral. Like  living rock with heavy fore claws. It's settling down now to completely  human readings."
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,"Band honours ready, Captain."
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,"We do, sir. Six hundred forty three miles, two thousand twenty  one feet, two point zero four inches at this moment, using your  old-style measurements."
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,"It is basic to the Vulcan philosophy, sir. The combination of a  number of things to make existence worthwhile."
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,"More that direction, Engineer."
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,"I am, Doctor. I am observing the alien."
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,"It would be illogical. With such abilities, they could as easily  trick us into destroying the entire vessel."
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,"No, I'm not, Doctor. There's no doubt they want us down there  for some hidden purpose. Otherwise, they would have revealed some  logical reason for all of this."
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,"Speculation is unnecessary, Captain. The answer is clear.  President Lincoln has always been a very personal hero to you. What  better way to titillate your curiosity than to make him come alive for  you."
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,"Agreed. I, too, experienced his charm. It is a magnificent work  of duplication."
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,"Captain, since I was included in the invitation to make contact,  I must beam down with you."
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,Captain. Our phasers and tricorders did not beam down with us.
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,"Undamaged, yet something is preventing them from functioning."
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,Surak.
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,"The greatest of all who ever lived on our planet, Captain. The  father of all we became."
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,"It is not logical that you are Surak. There is no fact,  extrapolation of fact or theory, which would make possible."
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,"Live long and prosper, image of Surak, father of all we now hold  true."
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,"As I turned and my eyes beheld you, I displayed emotion. I beg  forgiveness."
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,"It may be exactly as explained, Captain. Our concept of good and  evil is strange to them. Perhaps they wish to determine which is  strongest."
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,"I'm all right, Captain. However, I suggest that we prepare  ourselves for another attack."
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,"And if they're real, Captain?"
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,"Yes, Captain."
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,Captain. Logic dictates that we consider another course.
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,"His convictions are most profound in this matter, Captain."
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,"The captain knows that I have fought at his side before and will  do so now, if need be. However, I too, am a Vulcan, bred to peace. Let  him attempt it."
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,I deeply respect what he has accomplished.
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,"They're trying to goad us into attacking, Captain. They expect  us to act rashly."
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,He was aware of what might happen when he went.
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,"You had no choice, Captain. You could not have stopped him."
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,A Vulcan would not cry out so.
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,"I am not insensitive to it, Captain."
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,"Captain, that is what they are waiting for. They're waiting for  us to attempt a rescue."
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,"No, sir."
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,"Conjecture, Captain, rather than explanation."
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,It would seem that we were held in the power of creatures able  to control matter and to rearrange molecules in whatever fashion was  desired. So they were able to create images of Surak and Lincoln after  scanning our minds and using their fellow creatures as source matter.
The  Savage Curtain ,"7 Mar, 1969 ",77,"Yes, and Surak. Perhaps in a sense they were real, Captain.  Since they were created out of our own thoughts, how could they be  anything but what we expected them to be?"
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,"The power source we detected is in this building, Captain."
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,No signs of sapient life forms.
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,Reports deny that they had any space flight capability. This  appears to be an archive or library of some kind.
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,"Forgive me, sir. It is my fault. I must have miscalculated. Our  readings indicated that there was no one here at all."
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,"Three hours, thirteen minutes."
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,Exactly what is it that I'm expected to select?
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,I see. This is a fascinating machine. What is it?
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,Interesting nomenclature. How does it work? May I
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,"Thank you, Mister Atoz."
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,"Yes, and where is the captain?"
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,Heating this boulder may provide some  temporary heat.
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,Something's preventing my phaser from operating.
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,"Captain, we hear you, but we cannot see you."
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,Apparently they've all escaped the  destruction of their world by retreating into its past.
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,Indeed not. We're in a wilderness of arctic characteristics.
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,"There is no library, Captain, at least not  that we can see. We are at the base of an ice cliff."
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,"Just before you disappeared, Captain, I  discovered a machine which Mister Atoz called the atavachron."
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,Opening time portals to the past. You cross  through into the period which you were viewing.
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,"I am here, evidently, because I stepped through at the same  instant as Doctor McCoy."
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,We may be in trouble ourselves. We must find shelter.
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,"In this severe cold, we cannot survive much longer."
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,We go together or not at all.
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,We go together.
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,"He's suffering from the severity of your weather. Unfortunately,  he is the doctor, not I. I'll avoid giving him any medication at this  time. Perhaps, if he's kept quiet and warm, he may recover naturally.  It is agreeably warm here."
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,I'm called Spock.
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,Prisoners?
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,"Yes, we came through the time portal, but not as prisoners. We  were sent here by mistake."
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,That is true. I am not from the world you know at all. My home  is a planet millions of light years away.
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,Listen to me. I am firmly convinced that I do exist. I am  substantial. You are not imagining this.
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,"McCoy. McCoy, wake up."
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,"No, we are still in the Ice Age, but safe for the moment."
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,"Doctor, you're in no condition to get up. You lie down and rest.  I shall attempt to find the captain."
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,He's our commanding officer and our friend.
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,"He did not come with us. He was sent through the time portal to  another period in history much later than this one. If I am to find  him, there is only one possible avenue. Zarabeth, will you show me  where the time portal is?"
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,"Yes, that is true. If I leave him, there's a chance he may never  regain the ship. He would then be marooned in this time period. But he  is no longer in danger of death, so my primary duty to him has been  discharged. If I remain here, no one of our party would be able to aid  Captain Kirk."
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,"It should be an equation. I should be able to resolve this  problem logically. Perhaps it has something to do with the atavachron.  If only I knew more about how it worked. Zarabeth, you said that you  were brought here as a prisoner. May I ask"
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,I remember that name from the history tapes in the library. Zor  Kahn the Tyrant.
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,"Zarabeth, I must return to Mister Atoz and the atavachron. We  will carry Doctor McCoy, and you must come with us. I will send you and  the doctor to the ship, and I shall search for Captain Kirk."
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,You cannot go back?
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,"Come, Doctor, back to bed."
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,"It is impossible to look for him, Doctor. We cannot go back."
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,"Zarabeth explained it to me. When we came through the time  portal, it altered our physiological structure. If we attempt to return  to the library, we shall die."
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,"Yes, Doctor, we are trapped. Just as Jim is trapped wherever he  is.   Captain's log, stardate 5943.9. The people of this  time believe in witches, and witchcraft is what I've been accused of.  Five witnesses heard McCoy's voice speak to me and thought it was an  evil spirit. From what I know of witchcraft trials, I don't have much  chance unless I can get to the prosecutor."
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,Really?
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,Doctor McCoy is making excellent progress.
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,And known as the worst patient in the entire crew of the  Enterprise.
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,Five thousand years in the future.
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,"Who knows. We can only hope that he is well, wherever he is."
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,What was there to do?
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,"We've been through all that, Doctor. What's the point of  rehashing that subject? We can't get back. Wasn't that clear to you?"
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,Then perhaps you were too ill to understand what can't get back  means.
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,"Then I'll repeat it for you. Get this through your head. We  can't get back. That means we are trapped here in this planet's past  just as we are, and we'll stay here for the rest of our lives. Now do  you understand?"
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,The prospect appeared quite attractive to you a moment ago.
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,"I don't like that. I don't think I ever did, and now I'm sure."
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,Nothing that shouldn't have happened long ago.
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,I'm sorry. I know of no way to return you to your own time.
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,Yes. I know what it is like.
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,If it pleases you. This is animal flesh?
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,"Naturally, because of the climate. What is the source of heat in  the shelter?"
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,"Excellent. Then it will be possible to build a greenhouse of  sorts. Meanwhile, this will have to do as the only source of  nourishment."
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,But he evidently intended that you continue living.
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,"But insensitive, to send such a beautiful woman into exile. The  cold must've affected me more than I realised. Please pay no attention.  I'm not myself. I'm behaving disgracefully. I have eaten animal flesh  and I have enjoyed it. What is wrong with me? I tell you you're  beautiful. But you are beautiful. Is it so wrong to tell you so?"
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,You are beautiful. More beautiful than any dream of beauty I've  ever known.
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,"I've given you the facts, Doctor."
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,"You were told the truth. If Zarabeth is the source, what  difference does it make?"
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,She would not jeopardise other lives.
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,What are you doing to her?
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,This is impossible. Impossible. I am a Vulcan.
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,My ancestors are barbarians. Warlike barbarians.
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,I've lost myself. I do not know who I am. Can we go back?
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,"There's no portal here, Doctor. It's hopeless."
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,You're too ill to remain out here any longer. Give it up.
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,This must be it.
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,"You start ahead, Doctor. I do not wish to part from you."
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,How much time do we have?
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,"There's no further need to observe me, Doctor. As you can see,  I've returned to the present in every sense."
All  Our Yesterdays ,"14 Mar, 1969 ",78,"Yes, it happened. But that was five thousand years ago. And she  is dead now. Dead and buried. Long ago."
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,Captain. Tricorder picking up very faint life readings.  Approximately seven hundred metres from here. Help will have to be  immediate.
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,"Captain, that will delay our work at Beta Aurigae. It means  reversing course."
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,May I point out that Starbase Two is on the direct route to our  destination.
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,"If the diagnosis of Doctor Lester's illness is the critical  problem, then the Benecia Colony is definitely not the place for her.  Their medical facilities are the most primitive."
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,Starbase Two is fully equipped and staffed with the necessary  specialists to determine exactly what is wrong with the doctor. Is that  not crucial to your decision?
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,"At maximum speed, Starbase Two would still meet the emergency."
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,"Sir, I believe Starfleet will have to be notified that our  rendezvous with the starship Potemkin will not take place as scheduled."
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,"Since the captain usually deals with Starfleet in these matters,  I assumed that my suggestions might be deemed interference."
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,Good. Knowledge of the captain's aberrant behaviour is spreading  through the ship. The crew is becoming increasingly tense.
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,"I'm afraid that is a forlorn hope, Doctor. The illness appears  to be primarily mental."
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,Perhaps the Surgeon General's office should be alerted.
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,Are you sure that the captain will comply with your order in his  present state of mind?
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,"Doctor, we are treading on very thin ground. Actions such as  these might be misinterpreted."
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,Whatever happened to the captain on that planet must've taken  place in the short space of time that he was alone with Doctor Lester.  Perhaps a conversation with her might shed some light.
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,How is the doctor?
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,Good. I have questions to ask her.
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,"Why should he? They are my questions, therefore I am ordering  it, Lieutenant."
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,Has such an order ever included his senior officers?
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,"By all means, Lieutenant."
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,Complete life-entity transfer with the aid  of a mechanical device?
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,"To my knowledge, such total transfer has never been accomplished  with complete success anywhere in the galaxy."
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,"That is your claim. As yet, it is unsubstantiated by any  external evidence or objective tests."
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,"At this moment Doctor McCoy is examining the  captain for psychological changes. If any facts are uncovered, that  would be acceptable evidence. The only kind which is acceptable to  Starfleet Command and to the crew of the Enterprise."
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,"That is true. The captain did not. However, those events have  been recorded. They could have become known to you."
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,"I believe you. However, my belief is not acceptable evidence.  Evidence must be factual. Doctor McCoy may be of help. Come with me."
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,He is not the captain.
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,"Certainly, Lieutenant. We all must do our duty."
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,"It's quite all right, Ensign. Everything is  under control."
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,"A repetition of your physical violence is not called for, sir.  No physical resistance will be offered."
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,I have stated my evidence. Telepathic communication with the  mind of Captain James T. Kirk.
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,"You've had great deal of evidence, except that of the chief  witness. The one who should be the real subject of this investigation  is kept locked away and in isolation. Why, Captain?"
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,"She is dangerous only to your authority, sir."
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,"The witness, sir. Bring on the witness. Let your officers put  the questions."
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,I know them now.
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,I am disappointed and deeply concerned that there is no  objective evidence to support my position. So far.
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,"Sir, there is only one issue here. Is the story of life-entity  transfer believable? This crew has been to many places in the galaxy.  They've been witness to many strange events. They are trained to know  that what seems to be impossible often is possible, given the  scientific analysis of the phenomenon."
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,"Not precisely, no."
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,I expect only to reveal the truth.
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,And what will become of Doctor Lester?
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,"No, sir. I shall not withdraw a single charge that I have made.  You are not Captain Kirk. You have ruthlessly appropriated his body,  but the life entity within you is not that of Captain Kirk. You do not  belong in charge of the Enterprise and I shall do everything in my  power against you."
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,I do. And I stand by it.
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,"Yes, sir. An immediate vote before our chief witness can be left  to die on some obscure planet with the truth locked away inside of her."
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,Perhaps you were.
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,"To accomplish that, each one of us must be ready to seize any  opportunity to break out of here and attack."
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,"May I point out, Captain"
Turnabout  Intruder ,"3 Jun, 1969 ",79,"I'm sure we all understand that, Captain."
